IAM Introduction:
  IAM Overview:
    Stands for Identity and Access Management.
    IAM enables management of users, groups, and roles for AWS resource access.
    The root account has maximum privileges and should be used minimally for security.
    It as a global scope within AWS. 
      Users, groups, roles, and policies you create in IAM are accessible across all AWS regions. 
      Ensuring consistent IAM throughout your AWS account without the need for any configuration. 
    Users are for individuals.
    Groups for organizing users by function or team...
    Roles for AWS services or applications -EC2 instances, Lambda, Fargate, etc.-.
      Allow to securely access AWS resources without needing permanent credentials like: 
        Passwords or API keys.
      Used by AWS services or applications to perform actions on other AWS resources.
        Such as accessing an S3 bucket on behalf of the user or application.
      Role Assignment: 
        Instead of giving each service its own access credentials. 
          Create a role with specific permissions and then assign this role to the service, like:
            If an EC2 instance needs to read from an S3 bucket.
            You attach a role with "read" permissions to the EC2 instance.
      Temporary Credentials: 
        When a role is assigned, AWS provides temporary credentials to the service. 
        This ensures that access is limited to the time the role is active.
          Can be automatically renewed as needed.
      Security Benefit: 
        Since roles do not require hard-coded credentials. 
          They reduce the risk of credential exposure, keeping access secure and manageable.
      Roles is the recommended for granting temporary, scoped permissions to AWS services or app.

  Policies and Permissions:
    Policies are JSON documents.
    Define permissions for users, groups, and roles. 
    AWS provides managed policies to simplify setup.
    The principle of least privilege is essential. 
      Granting users and roles only the permissions necessary for their tasks.
  Security Best Practices:
    Enable multi-factor authentication.
    Avoid sharing IAM credentials.
    Never embed credentials in code.
    Enterprises can integrate IAM with existing user directories, like Active Directory. 
      Via IAM Federation.
    IAM Federation is an AWS IAM feature that may use SAML -Security Assertion Markup Language-.
  Account and Credential Safety:
    Never use or share the root account after setup, as it is highly privileged.
    Mishandling IAM credentials, especially in code, can lead to misuse and financial consequences.
      Such as unauthorized resource usage.
  User Directories: 
    Systems that store and manage user information. 
      Enabling streamlined authentication and authorization across multiple applications.
  Active Directory -AD-: 
    A Microsoft directory service for managing users and resources in a network. 
      Allowing centralized control over access. 
    Using IAM Federation, AWS integrates with AD for single sign-on, using existing AD credentials.
IAM Introduction:
  Introduction to IAM:
    Identity Access Management -IAM-
      Allows you to specify who or what can access services and resources in AWS.
      Centrally manage fine-grained permissions.
      Analyze access to refine permissions across AWS.
    Global service for managing user identities and access to AWS resources.
    Default root account is created but shouldn't be utilized or shared for security reasons.
  IAM identities -principal entities-:
    Users represent individuals within the organization and can be organized into groups.
    Groups exclusively contain users and cannot include other groups.
      Users aren't required to be in a group and can be members of multiple groups simultaneously.
    Roles used for machines or AWS services that need permissions to perform specific actions.
  IAM Permissions:
    Users or groups, or roles can be assigned JSON documents known as policies.
    Policies define the permissions granted to those users, groups, or roles.
      Depending on where the policy is applied.
    AWS follows the least privilege principle. 
      Users are given only the permissions they need to perform their tasks. 
        Minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or misuse.
  IAM Policies:
    JSON documents that define permissions for users, groups, or roles.
    Each policy consists of one or more statements, each with specific access permissions.
    Statements contain elements such as: 
      actions -allowed or denied-.
      Resources -the AWS resources to which the actions apply-.
      Conditions -optional criteria that must be met for the policy to be applied-.
    Attached to IAM identities -users, groups, or roles-. 
      To grant or restrict access to AWS resources.
    AWS provides: 
      Predefined policies for common use cases.
      Custom policies can be created to tailor permissions according to specific requirements.
  IAM Policy Structure:
    Version: Version of the policy language, always set to "2012-10-17."
    Id: Optional identifier for the policy.
    Statement: One or more individual statements -required-.
    Each statement consists of:
      Sid: An optional identifier for the statement.
      Effect: Specifies whether the statement allows or denies access -Allow, Deny-.
      Principal: The account, user, or role to which the policy is applied.
      Action: A list of actions that the policy allows or denies.
      Resource: A list of resources to which the actions are applied.
      Condition: Optional conditions for when the policy is in effect.
  IAM Shared Responsibility Model:
    AWS handles:
      Infrastructure -global network security-.
      Configuration and vulnerability analysis.
      Compliance validation.
    You, the customer, handle:
      Users, Groups, Roles, Policies management and monitoring.
      Enable MFA on all accounts.
      Rotate all your keys often.
      Use IAM tools to apply appropriate permissions.
      Analyze access patterns & review permissions.
Security within IAM:
  IAM Password Policy:
    Setting a strong password enhances the security of your AWS account.
    AWS allows you to establish a password policy, enabling you to:
      Specify a minimum password length.
      Mandate the inclusion of specific character types, such as: 
        Uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.
      Permit all IAM users to change their passwords.
      Enforce password expiration.
        Prompting users to change their passwords after a defined period.
      Prevent the reuse of passwords to enhance security further.
  IAM Multi-Factor Authentication:
    Users with access to your AWS account can modify configurations or delete resources. 
      posing security risks.
    It's essential to safeguard both root accounts and IAM users.
    Multi-Factor Authentication -MFA- adds an extra layer of security by: 
      Requiring users to provide both: 
        A password -something they know-.
        Security device -something they own-. 
      Reducing the risk of unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised.
      If a password is stolen or hacked, the account is not compromised.
  Multifactor Devices: 
    Manara potential error ❌. -no devices there-
    Virtual MFA Devices:
      Google Authenticator: A smartphone app that generates time-sensitive codes for MFA.
      AWS MFA: An app used to generate temporary security codes for AWS accounts.
    Hardware MFA Devices:
      YubiKey: A physical USB key that generates one-time passcodes for authentication.
    SMS-based MFA:
      AWS can send one-time passcodes via SMS to your mobile phone. 
        As an additional authentication method.
  AWS Management Console: 
    Web-based interface.
    Allows users to interact with and manage AWS services. 
    Provides a graphical user interface -GUI- for accessing and configuring AWS resources, such as: 
      EC2 instances, S3 storage, IAM roles, and more.
    Serves as the central hub for:
      Managing services: Creating, configuring, and monitoring AWS resources.
      Billing and cost management: Reviewing usage, cost, and generating reports.
      Security and IAM: Managing access permissions for users and roles.
      Automation: Running tasks and workflows for resource management.
    Where users and administrators perform day-to-day tasks related to AWS cloud management. 
      Providing an intuitive interface for both new and experienced users.
  AWS Command Line Interface:
    Facilitates interaction with AWS services via commands in your command-line shell.
    Provides direct access to the public APIs of AWS services.
    Enables the development of scripts for resource management.
    Open-source tool available at https://github.com/aws/aws-cli
    Serves as an alternative to using the AWS Management Console for AWS resource management tasks.
  AWS Software Development Kit -SDK-:
    Collection of language-specific APIs -libraries-.
    Enable you to programmatically access and manage AWS services.
    Can be embedded within your application and supports languages like: 
      JavaScript, Python, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Java, Go, Node.js, and C++. 
    Mobile SDKs: 
      For platforms like Android and iOS. 
    IoT Device SDKs: 
      For platforms like Embedded C and Arduino.
    An example of the AWS SDK in use is the AWS CLI, which is built on the AWS SDK for Python.
      AWS CLI is built on the AWS SDK for Python -Boto3-.
        The AWS CLI commands are essentially Python scripts that utilize the Boto3 library. 
          To communicate with AWS services.
      AWS CLI leverages the AWS SDK for Python -Boto3- to send requests to AWS services.
        Enabling users to manage their AWS resources through simple command-line commands.
  Access Keys in AWS:
    You can access AWS in three ways:
      AWS Management Console -protected by password + MFA-.
      AWS Command Line Interface -CLI-: protected by access keys.
      AWS Software Developer Kit -SDK- for code: protected by access keys.
    Access Keys are generated via the AWS Management Console.
    Users are responsible for managing their own access keys.
    Access Keys are treated as secrets and should not be shared.
      Don't share your access keys with anyone!
    The Access Key ID serves a similar purpose as a username.
    The Secret Access Key serves a similar purpose as a password.
  IAM Roles for Services:
    Certain AWS services require permission to perform actions on your behalf.
    To grant permissions, IAM roles are assigned to AWS services.
    Common roles include:
      EC2 Instance Roles.
      Lambda Function Roles.
      Roles for CloudFormation.
    IAM roles define the permissions and policies. 
      That govern what actions the associated service can perform.
  IAM Security Tools:
    IAM Credentials Report -Account-Level-: 
      Provides a comprehensive list of all users in your AWS account. 
        Along with the status of their various credentials.
      Enables tracking and monitoring of IAM users and their associated credentials.
        Including access keys and passwords.
    IAM Access Advisor -User-Level-: 
      Displays the service permissions granted to an IAM user.
      Shows the timestamp of the user's last access to each service.
      Helps in reviewing and revising IAM policies based on actual service usage.
        Ensuring adherence to the principle of least privilege.
  IAM Best Practices:
    Principle of Least Privilege:
      Grant users only the permissions they need to perform their tasks.
      Regularly review and refine IAM policies to remove unnecessary permissions.
    Use IAM Roles for AWS Resources:
      Assign IAM roles to AWS services like EC2 instances, Lambda functions. 
        Instead of using long-term access keys.
      Rotate IAM role credentials regularly for enhanced security.
    Enable Multi-Factor Authentication -MFA-:
      Require IAM users to use MFA to add an extra layer of security.
      Enforce MFA for privileged actions and console access.
    One physical user should have One AWS user.
    Create a strong password policy.
    Audit permissions of your account using IAM Credentials Report & IAM Access Advisor.
  IAM Guidelines and Best Practices:
    Root Account Usage: 
      Only use it for AWS account setup; otherwise, avoid using it for day-to-day operations.
    User Management: 
      Create a separate AWS user for each individual and avoid sharing credentials.
    Group Assignment: 
      Assign users to groups and manage permissions at the group level for easier management.
    Password Policy: 
      Implement a strong password policy to enhance security.
    Multi-Factor Authentication -MFA-: 
      Use and enforce MFA to add an extra layer of security.
    Roles for Services: 
      Use roles to grant permissions to AWS services rather than using individual user credentials.
    Programmatic Access: 
      Use access keys for programmatic access -CLI/SDK- and rotate them regularly.
    Audit Permissions: 
      Regularly audit permissions with tools like IAM Credentials Report and IAM Access Advisor.
    Access Key Management: 
      Never share IAM users and access keys; each should be unique to an individual or service.
