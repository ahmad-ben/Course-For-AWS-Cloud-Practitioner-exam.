Introduction:
  What we will learn:
    Explore Elastic Load Balancing -ELB- and Auto Scaling Groups -ASG- in AWS. 
    Discover how: 
      ELB distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets for high availability.
      ASG automatically adjusts EC2 instances to match demand, optimizing performance and costs. 
    Configure and manage ELB and ASG. 
      Integrate them effectively.
      Implement best practices for scaling applications. 
        By the end, you'll be ready to leverage these tools to enhance your AWS infrastructure.
Scalability and High Availability: An Introduction
  Scalability Introduction:
    The ability of an application or system to handle increasing loads by adapting.
    There are two types of scalability:
      Vertical Scalability
      Horizontal Scalability -also known as elasticity-.
    Scalability is closely related but distinct from High Availability. ??
    Vertical Vs Horizontal Scalability, consider a call center:
      Vertical Scalability: 
        Adding more resources -upgrading server hardware- to handle increased call volume.
      Horizontal Scalability: 
        Adding more call center agents to handle increased call volume. 
          Allowing workload distribution across multiple agents.
    High Availability 
      Ensures that systems remain operational and accessible despite failures. 
        Focusing on minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous service availability.
  Vertical Scalability
    Increasing the size of the instance, for example:
      If your application runs on a t2.micro, scaling it vertically means running it on a t2.large.
    Commonly used for non-distributed systems, like databases.
    Limit to how much you can vertically scale, determined by hardware limitations.
  High Availability
    High Availability often accompanies horizontal scaling. 
      Ensuring your application or system runs in at least two Availability Zones.
    Its primary goal is to maintain system operation despite a data center loss or disaster.
  High Availability & Scalability For EC2:
    Vertical Scaling -Scale Up-Down-:
      Increase the size of the instance.
    Horizontal Scaling -Scale Out-In-:
      Increase the number of instances.
      Utilize Auto Scaling Groups and Load Balancers for management.
    High Availability:
      Run instances of the same application across multiple Availability Zones -AZs-.
      Implement -ASG- and -ELB- across multiple AZs for increased reliability.
  Scalability vs Elasticity vs Agility:
    Scalability: 
      The ability to accommodate a larger load by either: 
        Enhancing the hardware -scale up- or adding nodes -scale out-.
    Elasticity: 
      In a scalable system, elasticity refers to the automatic scaling based on the load. 
        Enabling a pay-per-use model, demand matching, and cost optimization.
    Agility: 
      Unrelated to scalability. agility implies that new IT resources can be provisioned quickly. 
        Reducing the time to availability from weeks to minutes.
