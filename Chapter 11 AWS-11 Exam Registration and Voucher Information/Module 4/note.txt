  Next Steps
    After Completing this course your next step is to take the exam registration quiz.
    You must get a score of 100% on the Quiz in order to request your AWS Exam Voucher.
    We will begin voucher distribution in Week 5 of the program.
      Week 5 is counted from your live session start date.
      If you finish the program early and request your voucher.
        You will not receive it until week 5.
    You will not be able to request your voucher after the program deadline.
      You will have to re-enroll in a future live session.
    Once Voucher distribution begins in week 5.
      You will receive your Voucher code on email with the Subject line:
        AWS Voucher + Next Steps.
    When you receive your voucher.
      You will have exactly 48 hours to redeem your voucher and book your exam.
    No extension can be made to voucher redemption
    From your Registration day. 
      You will have 1 week to sit for the exam and report back your results.
    As a reminder you do not need to take the exam as soon as you book it with the voucher. 
      You can redeem and register in the future. Example: 
        You Receive your voucher on the 15th of October. 
        You redeem the voucher anytime before the 17th of October. 
        You sit for the exam anytime before the 23rd of October.
    If you do not redeem your voucher.
