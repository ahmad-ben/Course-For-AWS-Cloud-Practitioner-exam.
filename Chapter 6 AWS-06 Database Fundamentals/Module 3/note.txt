AWS Migration and Transfer Services:
  AWS Migration Hub: 
    Provides a centralized dashboard to manage migration projects.
  Database Migration Service -DMS-: 
    Migrates databases like Oracle, MySQL from on-premises or other clouds to AWS services. 
      RDS, Redshift, or DynamoDB. 
  Schema Conversion Tool: 
    Assists with schema differences between databases.
  Server Migration Service -SMS-: 
    Moves on-premises virtual machines like VMware, Hyper-V to Amazon EC2. 
      By creating Amazon Machine Images -AMIs- for incremental migration.
        AMI is updated with only the data that has changed since the last migration session. 
          Rather than re-creating the entire image from scratch each time.
  DataSync: 
    Syncs on-premises NAS storage to AWS S3, EFS, FSx with encryption in transit. 
    Can also be used with Snowcone for remote data transfers.
  Snowcone And DataSync:
    DataSync can be used with Snowcone by installing a DataSync agent on the Snowcone device. 
    This setup is helpful for: 
      Remote data transfers when internet connectivity is limited or unavailable. 
    Snowcone is a small, rugged, and portable edge computing device from AWS.
    Enables data collection, storage, and compute functions at the edge. 
    Often used in remote or disconnected environments.
    Once the DataSync agent is set up on Snowcone. 
      You can transfer data from the Snowcone device to AWS storage services like Amazon S3.
  Snowball Family: Physical devices like Snowball, Snowcone, Snowmobile for large data migrations.
    Snowball Edge offers compute capabilities for edge cases.
    Snowmobile transports massive datasets -up to exabytes- using a truck with a storage container.
  What is NAS: 
    Stands for Network Attached Storage.
    Centralized storage solution that connects to a network. 
    Allowing multiple users and client devices to access data from a shared location. 
    It operates on a network, typically using file-sharing protocols like: 
      NFS -Network File System- or SMB -Server Message Block-. 
    Suitable for applications where file sharing is essential.
Database Migration Services:
  DMS -Database Migration Service-:
    Quickly and securely migrates databases to AWS. 
      Ensuring resilience and self-healing capabilities.
    The source database remains available during the migration process.
      Source database remains active and accessible during migration.
        Minimal or no downtime for your original on-premises database while DMS copies data to AWS. 
    Supports both: 
      Homogeneous migrations for example from Oracle to Oracle.
      Heterogeneous migrations for example from Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora.
  AWS Schema Conversion Tool:
    Both solutions -DMS SC and SCT- automatically: 
      Convert database schemas and code objects.
      Marking unconvertible objects with manual conversion instructions.
    Scans app source codes for SQL statements.
      Optimizes them for AWS services during database migration.
        SCT tool inspects source code in applications for any SQL queries or statements. 
        Modifies them to work more efficiently with AWS databases.
          Making the migration smoother and ensuring better performance on AWS.
    Post-conversion: 
      AWS SCT facilitates data migration from various warehouses to Amazon Redshift.
        Using data migration agents.
    These tools: 
      Simplify migrations.
      Support popular databases.
      Save significant manual effort and resources.
    AWS offers two schema conversion solutions for database migrations: 
      The managed AWS DMS Schema Conversion -DMS SC-.
      The downloadable AWS Schema Conversion Tool -AWS SCT-.
      When using the AWS SCT, you will choose between two options for schema conversion:
        AWS DMS Schema Conversion -DMS SC-: 
          Managed service.
          Integrates with the DMS to convert schema automatically as part of the migration process.
        AWS Schema Conversion Tool -AWS SCT-: 
          Downloadable tool that allows you to perform schema conversion manually. 
          Gives you more control over the process.
AWS Databases Shared Responsibility Model:
  AWS:
    RDS sets up and runs the database engine on the instance provided.
    Maintenance and Operations:
      AWS manages OS and database engine maintenance and patching.
  Customer:
    Choose instance type and storage class for desired processing power and performance.
    Configure network access via security groups.
    Manage database users and permissions.
