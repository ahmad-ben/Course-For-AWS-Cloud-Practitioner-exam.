        You can present QuickSight data to users without them needing to leave the primary app.
      Per-session Pricing: 
        You don't pay for a fixed number of users or seats.
        It charges based on: 
          The number of sessions users interact with the embedded visualizations or reports. 
        Each time a user accesses or interacts with the reports, it counts as a session. 
          Charges are based on that session count. 
        This can be more cost-effective for organizations with varying user needs.
    Use cases include:
      Business analytics.
