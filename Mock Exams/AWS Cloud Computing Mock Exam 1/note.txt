  Q 2:
    The Question:
      A security engineer wants a single-tenant AWS solution to 
      create, control, and manage their own cryptographic keys to 
      meet regulatory compliance requirements for data security. 
      Which AWS service should the engineer use?
    The Options:
      AWS CloudHSM. ✔️ Correct Answer.
      AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). ❌ What I Chose.
      AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
      AWS Systems Manager.
    Why, for avoiding this again:
      AWS CloudHSM:
        Physical device. 
          Dedicated hardware security module hosted and managed by AWS in their data centers.
        Single-tenant. 
          HSM hardware is dedicated solely to your AWS account. 
          You do not share the physical hardware with any other AWS customer.
        HSM solution that allows you to create, control, and manage your cryptographic keys. 
          You access the HSM remotely via the AWS Cloud.
        It meets regulatory compliance requirements for data security.
          Providing full control over the HSMs and the keys stored within them.
        HSM standards for:
          Hardware security modules.
      Why not the others:  
        AWS Key Management Service -AWS KMS-: 
          KMS is a multi-tenant service where AWS manages the cryptographic modules. 
            Which may not meet the strict single-tenant requirements of some regulatory frameworks. 
        AWS Certificate Manager (ACM): 
          ACM is used to provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates. 
            Not for managing cryptographic keys.  
        AWS Systems Manager: 
          This service is used for operational management and automation.
            Not cryptographic key management.
      Key takeaway:
        For single-tenant and strict regulatory compliance, AWS CloudHSM is the right choice.

            allow, block, or count web requests based on conditions such as: 
              IP addresses, HTTP headers, URI strings, query string parameters, and body data.
      AWS Shield Standard vs. AWS WAF:
        AWS Shield Standard: 
          Protects against large-scale DDoS attacks. 
            Which aim to overwhelm the network or service itself. 
          It's a more general form of protection for AWS resources like EC2, ELB, and Route 53.
        AWS WAF: 
          Protects against application layer -HTTP/S- attacks, like: 
            SQL injection, XSS, and other exploits specific to web applications.
        So, for the specific case of HTTP attack protection. 
          AWS WAF is the service you would use. 
            As it is designed to inspect and filter HTTP requests based on customizable rules.

      Loose coupling
        The design principle that emphasizes minimizing dependencies between components of an app. 
        By using loose coupling.
          The failure of one component does not cause the entire system to fail. 
        This enables the app to remain available even if an individual component fails. 
          As each component can function independently or recover without impacting the others.
      Why not the others:
        Disposable resources: 
          This principle focuses on using temporary resources that can be replaced easily. 
            Such as spinning up new instances instead of repairing failed ones. 
          While it helps in scalability and fault tolerance. 
            It doesn't directly address the requirement.
              To keep an app available if a component fails.
        Automation: 
          Automation involves using scripts or tools to perform tasks automatically. 
          While automation can help with failover, scaling, and recovery. 
            It is not the primary design principle.
              For ensuring that the system remains available when individual components fail. 
        Rightsizing: 
          Rightsizing refers to ensuring that resources are appropriately sized for the workload. 
          While this helps optimize cost and performance.
            It does not address the application's availability in the case of failure.
      Conclusion:
        Loose coupling: 
          Is the design principle that ensures components can fail independently. 
            Without affecting the overall availability of the application.

      Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue in the same AWS Region 
        to manage writes to the DB instance.
      Convert the DB instance into a Multi-AZ deployment. ✔️ Correct Answer.
      Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue in a different AWS Region 
        to manage writes to the DB instance.
    Why, for avoiding this again:
      In Amazon RDS, a Multi-AZ deployment improves the availability of the database by: 
        Automatically replicating the data to a standby instance.
          In a different Availability Zone (AZ) within the same region. 
      If the primary instance fails or becomes unavailable.
        Amazon RDS will automatically failover to the standby instance with minimal downtime.
          Ensuring high availability and reliability for business-critical applications.
    Why not the others?
      Convert the DB instance into a multi-Region deployment: 
        This would provide high availability across regions.
          But it's more complex and generally used for: 
            Disaster recovery or global scalability. 
              Rather than just improving availability within a region.
      Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue 
        in the same AWS Region to manage writes to the DB instance: 
          SQS is a messaging service. 
            Not a database solution.
            Does not directly improve availability for database instances. 
            Not a relevant solution for improving DB instance availability.
