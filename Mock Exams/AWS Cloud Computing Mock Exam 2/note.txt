Questions i got wrong or didn't be sure about:
  Q 8:
    Question:
      A company needs to use standard SQL to 
      query and combine exabytes of structured and semi-structured data across a
      data warehouse, operational database, and data lake. 
      Which AWS service meets these requirements?
    Options:
      Amazon Aurora.
      Amazon DynamoDB.
      Amazon Athena.
      Amazon Redshift. ✔️ Correct answer, the same as mine, just wanna review the Redshift service.
    Why Amazon Redshift:
      Fully managed data warehouse service.
      Supports querying and combining large-scale data using standard SQL. 
      It is designed to handle structured and semi-structured data. 
      It can integrate with operational databases and data lakes.
        Using features like Redshift Spectrum. 
      It can process and analyze exabytes of data effectively.
      Redshift Spectrum allows querying data directly in Amazon S3 -data lake- without moving it.  
      It integrates with AWS Glue Data Catalog to query semi-structured data.  
      It supports federated queries to operational databases like Aurora or RDS.  
    Why not others:
      Amazon Aurora: 
        Relational database service that supports standard SQL.
        Primarily designed for transactional and operational databases.
          Not large-scale analytics across diverse data sources.  
      Amazon DynamoDB: 
        A NoSQL database designed for low-latency operations. 
          Not for querying large-scale structured or semi-structured data using SQL.  
      Amazon Athena: 
        Athena is great for querying data directly from S3 using SQL.
          Not designed for combining data across a: 
            Data warehouse, operational databases, and a data lake at the exabyte scale.  
  Q 10:  
    Question:  
      A batch workload takes 5 hours to finish on an Amazon EC2 instance. 
      The amount of data to be processed doubles monthly and the processing time is proportional.
      What is the best cloud architecture to address this consistently growing demand?  
    Options:  
      Run the application on a bigger EC2 instance size.  
      Switch to an EC2 instance family that better matches batch requirements.  
      Distribute the application across multiple EC2 instances and run the workload in parallel. 
        ✔️ Correct answer, the same as mine i just want to make sure about it.  
      Run the application on a bare metal EC2 instance.  
    Why Distribute the application across multiple EC2 instances and run the workload in parallel:  
      Allows the application to handle growing data volumes more efficiently. 
        By processing different parts of the workload concurrently.  
      Often called horizontal scaling. 
        Ensures that increasing demand is met by adding more compute capacity.  
      Parallel processing: 
        Reduces overall execution time.
        Makes the system more scalable and cost-efficient in the long term.  
      Running workloads in parallel is ideal for batch processing. 
        Where tasks are independent and can be processed simultaneously.
    Why not others:  
      Run the application on a bigger EC2 instance size: 
        This approach -vertical scaling- provides more power, but:
          Cannot handle the rapid data growth effectively since there are hardware limitations. 
          The scaling is limited by the instance size available.  
        Switch to an EC2 instance family that better matches batch requirements: 
          Changing instance families might improve efficiency slightly.
            But Will not address the fundamental scalability issue of rapidly growing data volumes.
        Run the application on a bare metal EC2 instance: 
          Bare metal instances provide direct hardware access. 
            But do not inherently improve scalability or parallel processing capabilities. 
            They are better suited for workloads requiring hardware-level control.  
  Q 11:  
    Question:  
      A company is building a serverless architecture 
      that connects application data from multiple data sources. 
      The company needs a solution that does not require additional code. 
      Which AWS service meets these requirements?  
    Options:  
      Amazon CloudWatch.  
      AWS Lambda.  
      Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).  
      Amazon EventBridge. ✔️ Correct answer, the same as mine i just want to make sure about it.  
    Why Amazon EventBridge:  
      Fully managed event bus service.
      Connects applications using events from multiple sources, including: 
        AWS services, SaaS applications, and custom applications.  
      Enables serverless architectures. 
        By allowing seamless integration of data sources. 
          Without requiring developers to write additional code.  
      Automatically routes and transforms events between producers and consumers. 
        Making it an ideal solution for this scenario.  
    Why not others:  
      Amazon CloudWatch:
        Primarily used for monitoring and observability, such as collecting logs and metrics. 
        Not designed for integrating data from multiple sources in a serverless architecture.  
      AWS Lambda: 
        Lambda can process data and integrate sources.
          But it requires writing custom code to handle integration.  
      Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS): 
        SQS is a message queuing service. 
        Requires additional logic and code to manage the integration of multiple data sources. 
        It does not inherently support event-driven architecture as EventBridge does.  
  Q 15:
    Question:  
      A company has identified a high-risk network security issue 
      during an AWS Well-Architected review. 
      The company needs a managed solution that the company can use to 
      deploy essential network protections for all of its VPCs. 
      Which AWS service or feature meets these requirements?  
    Options:  
      Network ACLs.  
      Security groups.  
      Amazon VPC Network Access Analyzer.  
      AWS Network Firewall. ✔️ Correct answer, the same as mine.  
    Why AWS Network Firewall:  
      Managed network protection solution designed to secure VPCs.  
      Provides advanced network protections, such as: 
        Stateful inspection.
        Intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS).
        Traffic filtering across all VPCs.  
      It integrates with AWS Firewall Manage.
        Enabling centralized management of firewall rules across multiple accounts and VPCs. 
          Which aligns with the company's needs for essential network protections.  
    Why not others:  
      Network ACLs:  
        Control traffic at the subnet level and provide basic stateless filtering.  
        Lack advanced security features like: 
          Intrusion detection, traffic inspection, and centralized management for multiple VPCs.  
      Security groups:  
        Provide instance-level protections. 
          But limited to controlling inbound and outbound traffic.  
        They do not offer centralized management or other advanced features like IDS/IPS.  
      Amazon VPC Network Access Analyzer:  
        Tool that identifies potential security and compliance risks in your VPC configurations.  
        It does not actively provide network protections.
          It is a diagnostic tool, not a preventive or protective solution.  
  Q 16:
    Question:  
      A company is running a critical workload on an Amazon RDS DB instance. 
      The company needs the DB instance to be highly available 
      with a recovery time of less than 5 minutes. 
      Which solution will meet these requirements?  
    Options:  
      Modify the DB instance to be a Multi-AZ deployment. ✔️ Correct answer, the same as mine.  
      Create a read replica of the DB instance.  
      Create a template of the DB instance by using AWS CloudFormation.  
      Take frequent snapshots of the DB instance. Store the snapshots in Amazon S3.  
    Why Multi-AZ deployment:  
      Provide high availability. 
        By automatically replicating the database to a standby instance in a different AZ.  
      If the primary DB instance fails.
        Amazon RDS automatically promotes the standby instance to become the new primary instance. 
          Ensuring minimal downtime and a recovery time within the required less than 5 minutes.  
      This solution is designed for critical workloads needing high availability and durability.  
    Why not others:  
      Create a read replica:  
        Read replicas are designed for read scalability, not high availability.  
        In the event of a failure.
          Do not automatically replace the primary DB instance and would require manual promotion. 
            Causing significant downtime.
      Create a template with CloudFormation:  
        CloudFormation templates are useful for deploying and managing resources.
          Not directly enhance availability or reduce recovery time.  
        Recovery from a failure using CloudFormation would involve redeployment.
          Which takes longer than 5 minutes.  
      Frequent snapshots:  
        Snapshots are used for data backup and recovery, not for high availability.  
        Restoring a database from snapshots is time-consuming.
          Cannot meet the 5-minute recovery requirement.  
  Q 18:  
    Question:  
      A company needs to reserve a certain amount of Amazon EC2 compute resources 
      in a specific Availability Zone within an AWS Region. 
      Which purchasing option should the company use to meet this requirement?  
    Options:  
      Regional Reserved Instances.
      EC2 Instance Savings Plans.
      Compute Savings Plans.
      Zonal Reserved Instances. ✔️ Correct answer.
    Why Zonal Reserved Instances:  
      Allow you to reserve EC2 capacity in a specific AZ.  
      Ensure that the requested compute resources are available in that specific zone. 
        Ideal for workloads that require high availability or specific placement strategies.  
      Option guarantees capacity reservation. 
        Unlike Regional Reserved Instances or Savings Plans. 
          Which are more flexible but do not lock resources to a specific Availability Zone.  
    Why not others:  
      Regional Reserved Instances:
        Provide reserved capacity across all AZ in a region.
          Do not guarantee reservation in a specific Availability Zone.  
        Offer flexibility in moving resources between zones.
          But do not meet the requirement for zone-specific reservations.  
      EC2 Instance Savings Plans:
        Savings Plans provide cost savings for specific EC2 instance usage.
          Do not reserve capacity or guarantee availability in any AZ.  
      Compute Savings Plans:
        Compute Savings Plans are broader and apply to any compute usage.
          Such as EC2, Fargate, or Lambda. 
        They do not include capacity reservation or zone-specific guarantees.

      Event-Driven: 
        Listens for events and triggers actions based on those events. 
          Events like changes to resources or new data.
        It doesn't define specific workflows like Step Functions.
          But is instead focused on reacting to changes in your system.
      Use Case: 
        Building event-driven apps where actions need to be triggered in response to events. 
      Example use case:
        When an object is uploaded to an S3 bucket. 
          EventBridge can route that event to a Lambda function to process the file.
    Key Differences:
      EventBridge is about reacting to events.
      Step Functions is about orchestrating the flow of tasks in a sequential or conditional order.
        Tasks like Lambda functions.
    Complexity:
      EventBridge is focused on routing events to targets without managing the flow of tasks.
      Step Functions can handle more complex logic, including retries, branching, and waiting.
    Use Together:
      These services can be used together. For example: 
        EventBridge could trigger an event.
        Step Functions could orchestrate a series of tasks in response to that event.

      Which S3 feature will meet these requirements?  
    Options:  
      S3 Storage Lens.
      S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR).
      S3 Versioning.
      S3 Access Points. ✔️ Correct answer.
    Why S3 Access Points:  
      Allow creating unique access configurations for specific applications or customers. 
      Each access point provides a unique hostname and policies.
        Enabling granular control over what data is accessible. 
          Ensuring customers can view specific data without exposing the entire bucket dataset.  
    Why not others:  
      S3 Storage Lens: 
        Provides visibility into storage usage and activity metrics.
        Does not facilitate controlled access to specific data.  
      S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR): 
        Automatically replicates S3 objects across regions for durability and availability.
        Does not offer data access management.  
      S3 Versioning: 
        Maintains multiple versions of objects in a bucket, enabling recovery.
        Does not control or manage customer-specific data access.  
  Q 61:  
    Question:  
      A company needs to optimize the cost of its compute resources. 
      Which type of workload should the company run on Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances?  
    Options:  
      A steady-state workload that requires a particular EC2 instance configuration 
        for a long period of time. ✔️ Correct answer.  
      A short-term workload that can be interrupted.  
      A steady-state workload that does not require a long-term commitment.  
      A short-term workload that cannot be interrupted.  
    Why Steady-state workload with a long-term commitment:  
      Amazon EC2 RIs: 
        Designed for workloads that require: 
          Consistent and predictable compute capacity for an extended period. 
        They provide significant cost savings: 
          Up to 75% compared to On-Demand instances in exchange for a 1 or 3 year commitment.  
        Ideal for steady-state apps such as: 
          Web servers, databases, or backend processing that run continuously.  
    Why not others:  
      Short-term workload that can be interrupted: 
        Spot Instances are cost-effective for workloads that can tolerate interruptions.  
          Not Reserved Instances.  
      Steady-state workload without long-term commitment: 
        On-Demand Instances are better suited for this scenario. 
          As they offer flexibility without long-term commitments.  
      Short-term workload that cannot be interrupted: 
        On-Demand Instances would be a better option here, since they: 
          Don't require a long-term commitment.
          Provide uninterrupted compute resources.

Manara potential error ❌.
  Until now, all the question that has an option referring to two options.
    That option is always the correct choice.
  Example:
    We have four options:
      1- A And 2- B And 3- C And 4- A & C 
        The option 4 is referring to two options so it will be the right now.
