Introduction:
  What is Cloud Computing:
    The delivery of computing services over the internet, also called cloud.
      Services like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence.
    Offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. 
    Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers. you can: 
      Access these resources on-demand from a cloud provider, such as AWS -Amazon Web Services-.
    Transforms modern IT, providing instant access to shared resources via: 
      Virtualization, scalability, and flexible payment models. 
Introduction to AWS and Cloud Computing:
  Cloud Computing VS Traditional IT Approach:
    Cloud Computing:
      Pay-as-you-go pricing.
      Flexible resource provisioning.
      Quick access to virtually unlimited resources.
    Traditional IT Approach:
      Infrastructure monitoring and disaster preparedness concerns.
      Limited resources.
      Time and money consuming for instal, maintain, upgrade.
6 Advantages of Cloud Computing:
  Trade capital expense -CapEx- for variable expense -OpEx-:
    Instead of large upfront capital expenses -CapEx- for infrastructure. 
    Cloud services use a pay-as-you-go -OpEx- model. 
      Allowing businesses to pay only for what they use and deduct expenses in the same tax year.
    CapEx VS OpEx:
      OpEx -Operational Expenditure- refers to ongoing costs incurred in daily operations. 
        Such as cloud services, utilities, and salaries. 
        Can be deducted in the same tax year, providing flexibility based on usage. 
        Allows businesses to be more agile and responsive to changing needs.
      CapEx -Capital Expenditure- involves significant one-time investments in physical assets:
        Servers and data centers. 
          Which are depreciated over several years and represent long-term commitments. 
        Ties the businesses to fixed investments.
  Benefit from massive economies of scale:
    AWS aggregates usage across its large customer base. 
      Leveraging purchasing power to lower costs.
        Which are passed on to customers as lower variable costs.
  Stop guessing capacity:
    Cloud computing allows businesses to adjust capacity based on actual demand. 
      Eliminating the problem of over-provisioning and wasted resources.
  Increase speed and agility:
    AWS enables rapid deployment of resources via API calls, command line, or console. 
      Allowing companies to quickly: 
        Respond to changes.
        Compete by bringing products to market faster.
  Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers:
    AWS encourages businesses to focus on innovation rather than maintaining data centers. 
      As it doesn't add value to the business or provide competitive advantage.
  Go global in minutes:
    AWS allows businesses to deploy resources globally with ease. 
      Something that was traditionally complex and time-consuming.

Cloud Computing: Deployment Models
  Private Cloud: 
    Infrastructure is hosted in your own data center. 
    Giving organizations complete control over hardware, software, and security. 
    It requires software layers -from VMware, Microsoft, Red Hat- to manage the cloud environment. 
      Offering customized and secure solutions -Provide some cloud management software-.
    Though AWSâ€™s public cloud security is often hard to match in this cases since it's complex.
  Public Cloud: 
    Offered by third-party providers -AWS, Azure, Google Cloud-. 
    The public cloud is accessible to multiple users. 
    It provides elasticity, operational expenditures -OpEx- instead of -CapEx-. 
    While generally cost-efficient, private clouds may still be cheaper for specific workloads.
  Hybrid Cloud: 
    Connects private and public clouds, allow organization to run application in both environments. 
    Move data and services between infrastructures by VPNs or private links -AWS Direct Connect-.
      Giving flexibility for application deployment and scalability.
    Allow us to keep the critical apps and sensitive data in out data center.
  Multicloud: 
    Involves using multiple cloud services -public and/or private- from different providers. 
    This approach allows organizations to choose the best cloud for specific applications. 
      Increases complexity, which may impact security and operational efficiency.
===================================================================================================
Then we have the public cloud. So, the  public cloud is a cloud service where,  
of course, multiple customers, multiple  organizations, are utilizing this,  
and anyone really can sign up  and start using the public cloud.
Now, if we do that, it becomes a hybrid cloud  if we provide that sort of connectivity at the  
network layer from our office or data center into  the public cloud, especially if we're deploying  
some infrastructure locally in the data center as  well and providing that cross-communication. Now,  
in the public cloud, we can deploy various  services. Of course, there's hundreds of  
different services in the public cloud. In  terms of benefits with the public cloud,  
we have that variable expense, so it's an Opex,  an operational expenditure, rather than a capital  
expenditure or Capex cost. Rather than spending  large quantities of cash building our own systems,  
we're just spending on a monthly basis based on  what we use. And then we have economies of scale,  
so the public cloud can be very cost-effective.  The fact that AWS has created such a large  
infrastructure and created the software  capabilities and the services which so many  
customers can use means that they can lower the  price to you. Doesn't mean it's always cheaper.  
In some cases, using a private cloud can be  cheaper for certain applications and certain  
workloads. But don't forget to factor in all the  operational costs, the security, the data center,  
and all those sorts of aspects as well. And then  we have massive amounts of elasticity in the  
public cloud. It's almost limitless. If you scale  your business really quickly, there's capacity  
there for you. Very hard to replicate that, if  not impossible, in a private cloud situation. So,  
here, of course, we have AWS, Azure, Google  Cloud Platform, and other providers as well.
So, the hybrid is what we saw before,  
but where we're actually connecting  our data center and the cloud.
So, not just the people in the office, but we now  actually have the full data center and whatever  
application we have in our data center on-premises  connected into the public cloud with a connection  
which, again, can be a virtual private network  over the Internet or it can be a private link  
like AWS Direct Connect. So, here we can choose  where to put our applications. Some might make  
sense in the data center, some might make more  sense in the public cloud, and we can leverage  
different services for our various applications  as well, like SaaS services or Platform as a  
Service or IaaS in the cloud. Maybe we even just  use it as a burst capacity or a backup; that's  
what some organizations do. We can also easily  move data and applications and services between  
these different deployment models because we've  set up this connectivity between them as well.
Lastly, we have multicloud. This is becoming a  lot more common. All this really means is that  
a company is finding the need to leverage multiple  public and private cloud services. They might find  
that some applications they prefer to deploy into  Azure. Maybe that's because one of the development  
teams in part of the company are more interested  in .NET and they like to use PowerShell, and  
they're used to the Microsoft stack. Or maybe you  just prefer the identity features and integration  
into Office 365, for example. Other applications  might make more sense in the AWS cloud, so they  
put some in there as well. And then they might  even have multiple private clouds built on VMware,  
OpenStack, and other providers, and they've got  full connectivity between these different clouds.  
That's a multicloud environment, and it means you  get the best of these different clouds. Of course,  
that does increase complexity, so  it's not always the best for things  
like security or operational efficiency,  but it is quite a common scenario today.
