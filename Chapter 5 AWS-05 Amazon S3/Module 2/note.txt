Characteristics of S3
  Characteristics of Amazon S3
    Durability:
      Measures the likelihood of data remaining intact and not getting lost or corrupted over time.
      High durability of 99.999999999% -11 9's- for objects.
        Ensuring data is protected across multiple AZs.
      If you store 10 million objects, you can expect to lose a single object each 10,000 years.
      This durability applies to all storage classes.
    Availability:
      Likelihood that you’ll be able to access your data when needed. 
      Refers to how readily available a service is for use.
      Availability varies depending on the storage class, for example:
        S3 Standard has 99.99% availability.
          Equates to potential unavailability of approximately 53 minutes per year.
  Static Websites and Versioning:
    S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the Internet.
    The website URL will be -depending on the region-:
        http://bucket-name.s3-website-aws-region.amazonaws.com
      OR:
        http://bucket-name.s3-website.aws-region.amazonaws.com
  Versioning:
    File versioning is available in Amazon S3.
      You can version your files.
    It is enabled at the bucket level.
    Same key overwrite will change the "version": 1, 2, 3….
      Overwriting a file with the same key will result in incrementing the version number.
    It is best practice to version your buckets.
    Protect against unintended deletes -ability to restore a version-.
    Easy roll back to previous version.
      It simplifies the process of reverting to an earlier version of a file.
    Additional details:
      Any file not versioned before versioning is enabled will be assigned the version "null".
      Suspending versioning will not remove any previously stored versions.
        Turning off versioning won't delete any previously saved versions of your objects. 
        All earlier versions will remain in the bucket. 
        New uploads won't create additional versions until versioning is turned back on.
  Replication -Cross Region Replication and Same Region Replication-:
    Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets for replication.
      Versioning is a mandatory requirement for S3 replication. 
      whether you're using -CRR- or -SRR-. 
        It must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets for replication to function.
      This ensures that any changes, deletions, or additions to objects are: 
        Consistently tracked and replicated across the buckets.
    Supports:
      Cross-Region Replication -CRR- Same-Region Replication -SRR-.
      Buckets can be in different AWS accounts.
        The source and destination buckets do not have to belong to the same AWS account. 
        You can set up replication between:
          Two buckets in the same AWS account.
          Two buckets in different AWS accounts.
        Allows data replication across accounts.
      Copying of objects is asynchronous.
      Proper IAM permissions must be granted to S3 for replication.
S3 Storage Classes:
  Availability in S3: 
    measures the percentage of time data can be accessed. 
    Storage classes offer varying availability, from 99.5% for S3 One Zone-IA to 99.99% for others.
  S3 has different storage classes to suit various use cases:
    Standard Classes: 
      Designed for frequently accessed data, with minimal latency and high availability.
    Intelligent Tiering: 
      Automatically moves data between tiers based on access patterns.
    Infrequent Access -IA-: 
      Suitable for data accessed less frequently, with reduced costs but some retrieval fees, like: 
        Minimum capacity charge per object, Minimum storage duration time, Retrieval fee. 
    One Zone-IA: 
      Stores data in a single availability zone, lowering cost but reducing availability.
    Glacier Classes -for archival data- provide low-cost, long-term storage:
      Glacier Instant Retrieval:
        Offers low-latency access for archived data.
      Glacier Flexible Retrieval:
        Cost-effective for data rarely accessed, with retrieval time range from minutes to hours.
      Glacier Deep Archive:
        Cost-effective for data rarely accessed, with retrieval times of hours.
  Unique pattern to remember:
    For all the storage classes that usually their data shouldn't be usually accessed we have:
      Minimum capacity charge per object, Minimum storage duration time, Retrieval fee.
        As an additional fee, and that's for AWS to ensure the users don't exploit this classes. 
S3 Storage Classes

    About S3 Encryption:
      Server-Side Encryption -SSE-: 
        AWS manages encryption and decryption for your data, with three main types:
          SSE-S3: 
            S3 manages both the encryption keys and the encryption process, using AES-256.
          SSE-KMS: 
            Managed by AWS Key Management Service -KMS-. 
              Offers more control over encryption keys and enables audit logging of key usage.
          SSE-C: 
            Customer-provided keys are used for encryption. 
            AWS manages the encryption process, but you supply and manage the encryption key.
      Client-Side Encryption: 
        The customer fully manages the encryption keys and processes.  
        The encryption and decryption process is handled client-side. 
          Data is encrypted before it is uploaded to S3, and decrypted after downloading. 
  IAM Access Analyzer for S3:
    Feature designed to help you secure access to your S3 buckets by: 
      Ensuring that only authorized users have access.
    Ensures only intended individuals have access to your S3 buckets.
    Evaluates S3 Bucket Policies, S3 ACLs, and S3 Access Point Policies.
    Powered by IAM Access Analyzer.
      Feature within AWS Identity and Access Management -IAM-.
    Identifies and flags any unintended access configurations, such as: 
      Buckets that are publicly accessible or shared with other AWS accounts
  Shared Responsibility Model for S3:
    AWS Responsibility:
      Guarantee unlimited storage.
      Provide encryption for stored data.
      Ensure data separation between different customers.
      Ensure AWS employees cannot access your data.
    Your Responsibility:
      Configure S3 buckets.
      Set bucket policies and public access settings.
      Manage IAM users and roles.
      Enable encryption for data storage.
  S3 Access Points:
    Network endpoints that enable fine-grained access control to Amazon S3 buckets. 
    The S3 Access Point Policies are policies applied specifically to S3 Access Points. 
    Each Access Point has a unique URL or DNS name and its own policy. 
      Allow precise control over permissions for different apps or user groups in the same bucket.
      For example: 
        Create multiple Access Points for a single bucket, each with distinct policies.
          Defining how specific apps or users interact with the bucket's data. 
        Instead of accessing the bucket through its standard URL, for example:
          https://bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com. 
          Users or applications access it via an Access Point-specific URL, like: 
            https://access-point-name.s3-accesspoint.region.amazonaws.com. 
        This approach simplifies access management. 
          As each Access Point enforces the permissions specified in its policy. 
          Offering customized and secure access to the bucket without modifying the bucket policy.
  ACLs -Access Control Lists- VS Bucket Policies:
    ACLs: 
      Offer basic, object-level permissions. 
      Allow you to grant permissions only at the bucket or object level to:
        AWS accounts and predefined groups like everyone or authenticated users.
      Control is limited to -read- and -write- permissions at the bucket and object levels.
      Best suited for simpler use cases where minimal access control is sufficient, for example: 
        Making an object publicly readable.
      Legacy method and are generally discouraged in favor of bucket policies. 
        Especially in newer S3 implementations.
    Bucket Policies: 
      JSON-based policies applied at the bucket level. 
      Offering more advanced control over access. 
      They allow for complex conditions, actions, and user-specific permissions, including: 
        permissions for users in different AWS accounts.
      More granular control, supporting actions like: 
        -PutObject- or -GetObject- and enabling condition keys like:
          IP address conditions or time-based conditions. 
        Enforce specific access conditions beyond simple -read- or -write- permissions.
      Recommended for complex access management, especially when you need to: 
        Manage access for different AWS accounts. 
        Enforce encryption.
        Apply multiple conditions. 
        Be more comprehensive and adaptable for larger environments.
        Follow strict security policies.
      The recommended approach by AWS for managing permissions.
