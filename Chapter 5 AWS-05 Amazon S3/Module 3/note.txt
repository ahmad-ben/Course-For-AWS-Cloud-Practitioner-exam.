S3 Migration
  Migrating data to Amazon S3: 
    Transferring existing data from on-premises storage systems or other cloud providers to S3. 
    This process can be performed using various methods, like: 
      AWS DataSync.
      AWS Snow Family -Snowball, Snowcone, Snowmobile-. 
      Direct data transfer methods over the internet.
  Why do we need snow migration:
    Challenges with data migration:
      Limited connectivity.
      Limited bandwidth.
      High network cost.
      Shared bandwidth -can’t maximize the line-.
        Unable to fully utilize the total bandwidth capacity of your internet connection. 
          Because that bandwidth is shared among multiple users or applications.
      Connection stability.
  The Snow Family:
    Highly-secure, portable devices designed for data collection and processing at the edge.
    Facilitate the migration of data into and out of AWS.
    Data migration:
      Snowball Edge.
      Snowcone.
      Snowmobile.
    Edge computing:
      Snowcone.
      Snowball Edge.
  Simple image explains the process of data migration with Snowball Edge:

  Snowball Edge -for data transfers-:
    Physical Data Transport Solution: 
      Enables the movement of terabytes -TBs- or petabytes -PBs- of data in or out of AWS.
    Alternative to Network Transfer: 
      Cost-effective alternative to transferring data over the network and incurring network fees.
    Pay-per-Transfer Job: 
      Charges are based on each data transfer job.
    Storage Options: 
      Provides block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage.
    Snowball Edge Storage Optimized: 
      Offers 80 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3-compatible object storage.
    Snowball Edge Compute Optimized: 
      42 TB of HDD.
      28TB NVMe capacity for block volume and S3-compatible object storage.
    Ideal for large data cloud migrations, data center decommissioning, and disaster recovery.
  AWS Snowcone & Snowcone SSD:
    Small, portable computing device designed for use in rugged and harsh environments.
    Lightweight, weighing 4.5 pounds -2.1 kg-.
    Suitable for edge computing, storage, and data transfer.
    Snowcone:
      Offers 8 TB of HDD storage.
    Snowcone SSD:
      Provides 14 TB of SSD storage.
    Ideal for use in space-constrained environments where Snowball doesn't fit.
    Users must provide their own battery and cables.
    Returned to AWS offline or connected to the internet and used with AWS DataSync to send data.
  AWS Snowmobile:
    Designed to transfer exabytes of data -1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1,000,000 TBs-.
    Each Snowmobile has a capacity of 100 PB.
    Multiple Snowmobiles can be used in parallel for larger transfers.
    Features high security with temperature control, GPS tracking, and 24/7 video surveillance.
    More suitable than Snowball for transfers exceeding 10 PB.
    AWS Snowmobile service uses a real, large truck designed specifically for data transfer, see:
      ./assets/S3 Migration/snowmobile-service-truck.png
  What is Edge computing: 
    The practice of processing data closer to the source of data generation. 
      Rather than relying solely on centralized data centers. 
    This approach: 
      Reduces latency.
      Enhances speed.
      Improves the efficiency of data processing. 
        Allow real-time analysis and decision-making at or near the location of data creation. 
    Particularly useful in scenarios involving: 
      IoT devices, autonomous vehicles, and applications requiring immediate responses.

S3 Migration: Usage Processes
  S3 Snow Family: Usage Process
    Request Snowball Devices: 
      Order Snowball devices through the AWS Management Console for delivery to your location.
    Install Software: 
      Install the Snowball client or AWS OpsHub on your servers to facilitate data transfer.
    Connect and Copy: 
      Connect the Snowball device to your servers and copy files using the client software.
    Return Device: 
      Ship the device back to AWS. 
      Once the data transfer is complete: 
        The device is pre-configured to return to the correct AWS facility.
    Data Transfer to S3: 
      Upon receipt, AWS will transfer the data from the Snowball device into an Amazon S3 bucket.
    Data Wiping: 
      After data transfer, the Snowball device is completely wiped to ensure security and privacy.
  Edge Computing:
    Process data as it's being generated at an edge location, that can be:
      Moving truck, a ship at sea, or a mining station underground.
        These locations may have: 
          Limited or no internet access.
          Limited or no easy access to computing power.
        So we can set up a Snowball Edge or Snowcone device to enable edge computing capabilities.
  Use Cases of Edge Computing:
    Preprocessing data before sending it to the cloud.
    Running machine learning models directly at the edge.
    Transcoding media streams on-site. 
      Process of converting media files like audio or video from one format to another.
        At the location where the media is being recorded or stored.
    Data Transfer: 
      If needed, the device can be shipped back to AWS for data transfer or further processing.
  Snowcone & Snowcone SSD:
    2 CPUs, 4 GB of memory, wired or wireless access.
    USB-C power using a cord or the optional battery.
      Can be powered through a USB-C connection using: 
        A standard power cord or by using an optional external battery.
  Snowball Edge – Compute Optimized:
    104 vCPUs, 416 GiB of RAM.
    Optional GPU for video processing or machine learning.
    28TB NVMe or 42TB HDD usable storage.
      NVMe: 
        Stands for Non-Volatile Memory Express a high-speed storage protocol designed for SSDs. 
        Provides faster data transfer rates and lower latency.
          Compared to traditional storage protocols. 
    Storage Clustering available -up to 16 nodes-.
      Storage Clustering:
        The technique of combining multiple storage devices -nodes- to function as:
          A single storage unit. 
            Enhancing performance, reliability, and capacity. 
      You can link together up to 16 individual Snowball Edge devices. 
        Creating a larger, more powerful storage solution. 
        Each node contributes its resources to the cluster, allowing for: 
          Parallel processing and increased data throughput.
  Snowball Edge – Storage Optimized:
    Up to 40 vCPUs, 80 GiB of RAM, 80 TB storage.
  Common Features:

    Long-term deployment options available with 1 and 3 years discounted pricing.
  AWS OpsHub
    Software installed on your computer or laptop, can be used to manage Snow Family devices.
      Historically, using Snow Family devices required a Command Line Interface -CLI- tool.
    OpsHub enables:
      Unlocking and configuring single or clustered devices.
      Transferring files to and from the device.
      Launching and managing instances running on Snow Family devices.
      Monitoring device metrics such as storage capacity and active instances.
      Launching compatible AWS services on your devices, such as: 
        Amazon EC2 instances, AWS DataSync, and Network File System -NFS-.
  Snowball Edge Pricing:

        You pay upfront for using a Snowball Edge device over a predefined period.
      Offers up to 62% discounted pricing compared to on-demand rates.
  Hybrid Cloud for Storage -Hybrid Cloud Approach-:
    AWS promotes a hybrid cloud model where: 
      Part of your infrastructure is on-premises and part is on the cloud.
    This approach may be due to:
      Long cloud migration processes.
      Specific security requirements.
      Compliance requirements.
      Overall IT strategy.
    S3 and On-Premises Integration: 
      S3 Problem:
        S3 is a proprietary storage technology, unlike EFS or NFS. 
          Technology is exclusive to AWS.
            Not based on open standards like other storage solutions.
        S3 Uses its own unique system for managing and storing data, which is specific to AWS. 
          Unlike EFS -Elastic File System- or NFS -Network File System-. 
            Follow standard file system protocols widely compatible across different platforms. 
          S3's storage structure and access methods are unique to AWS.
          S3 doesn't use traditional file system protocols directly. 
        Extra steps or tools are needed to access or integrate S3 data in on-premises environments.
      How do you expose S3 data on-premises:
        The solution is AWS Storage Gateway.
          Provides a seamless way to connect on-premises environments with S3 storage.
            Enabling hybrid cloud storage solutions!
  AWS Storage Gateway:
    Hybrid Storage with AWS S3:
      Connects on-premise data systems seamlessly with AWS Cloud.
