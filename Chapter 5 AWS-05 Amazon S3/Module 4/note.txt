Summary
  Buckets vs Objects: 
    Buckets have globally unique names and are tied to a specific region.
    Objects are the individual files stored within buckets.
  S3 Security: 
    Security measures include: 
      IAM policies. 
      S3 Bucket Policies for public access control.
      S3 Encryption for data protection.
  S3 Websites: 
    Amazon S3 can host static websites without the need for servers.
  S3 Versioning: 
    Allows for storing multiple versions of files.
      Providing protection against accidental deletions.
  S3 Replication: 
    Enables replication of data within the same region or across regions. 
      Requiring versioning to be enabled.
  S3 Storage Classes: 
    Different storage classes include: 
      Standard.
      IA -Infrequent Access-.
      1Z-IA "One Zone-IA".
      Intelligent Tiering.
      Glacier options -Instant Retrieval, Flexible Retrieval, Deep Archive-.
  Snow Family: 
    A set of physical devices like Snowball and Snowcone for: 
      Importing data onto S3 and performing edge computing.
  OpsHub: 
    Desktop application for managing Snow Family devices. 
      Simplifying operations like data transfer and device configuration.
  Storage Gateway: 
    A hybrid storage solution that extends on-premises storage to S3. 
      Facilitating seamless integration between local storage systems and the cloud.

    Quiz Q&A:
      Q1:
        The question:
          What is the significance of SSE-S3 encryption in Amazon S3?
        Options:
          It encrypts data at rest using keys managed by AWS. ✔️
          It encrypts data at rest using keys managed by the customer.
          It encrypts data in transit between the client and S3 using SSL/TLS.
          It ensures the integrity of data stored in S3 by performing checksum validation.
      Q2:
        The question:
          How does Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering differ from Standard S3 storage class?
        Options:
          Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves data to the Glacier storage class 
            based on access patterns, while Standard S3 does not.
          Intelligent-Tiering provides lower durability than Standard S3.
          Intelligent-Tiering is suitable for infrequently accessed data, 
            while Standard S3 is for frequently accessed data. ✔️
          Intelligent-Tiering has higher storage costs compared to Standard S3.
      Q3:
        The question:
          What is the purpose of Cross-Region Replication (CRR) in Amazon S3?
        Options:
          To automatically compress data before storing it in S3.
          To synchronize data between multiple S3 buckets within the same region.
          To replicate data across multiple AWS regions for disaster recovery and compliance. ✔️
          To encrypt data in transit between S3 and client applications.
      Q4:
        The question:
          How does Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration improve data transfer speed?
        Options:
          By compressing data before transferring it to S3.
          By utilizing AWS Direct Connect for dedicated network connectivity.
          By caching frequently accessed data in edge locations using Amazon CloudFront.
          By optimizing network routing to reduce latency in data transfer to S3. ✔️
      Q5:
        The question:
          A Cloud Practitioner needs to store data for 7 years to meet regulatory requirements.
          Which AWS service will meet this requirement at the LOWEST cost?
        Options:
          Amazon S3.
          AWS Snowball.
          Amazon Redshift.
          Amazon S3 Glacier. ✔️
  Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration:
    Feature of Amazon S3. 
    Improves data transfer speed by using AWS's global network of edge locations to: 
      Optimize the route between your clients and your S3 buckets. 
        This reduces latency by finding the fastest path through AWS's network.
    The process of optimizing network routing with Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration starts when: 
      Traffic first reaches an AWS edge location. 
        Once the data arrives at the nearest edge location. 
        AWS's global network routes it through the most efficient path to reach the S3 bucket. 
          Reducing latency and improving transfer speeds over long distances.
