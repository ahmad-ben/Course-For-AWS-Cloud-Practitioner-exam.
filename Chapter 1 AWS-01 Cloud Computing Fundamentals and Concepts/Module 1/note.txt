Introduction:
  What is Cloud Computing:
    The delivery of computing services over the internet, also called cloud.
      Services like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence.
    Offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. 
    Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers. you can: 
      Access these resources on-demand from a cloud provider, such as AWS -Amazon Web Services-.
    Transforms modern IT, providing instant access to shared resources via: 
      Virtualization, scalability, and flexible payment models. 
Introduction to AWS and Cloud Computing:
  Cloud Computing VS Traditional IT Approach:
    Cloud Computing:
      Pay-as-you-go pricing.
      Flexible resource provisioning.
      Quick access to virtually unlimited resources.
    Traditional IT Approach:
      Infrastructure monitoring and disaster preparedness concerns.
      Limited resources.
      Time and money consuming for instal, maintain, upgrade.
6 Advantages of Cloud Computing:
  Trade capital expense -CapEx- for variable expense -OpEx-:
    Instead of large upfront capital expenses -CapEx- for infrastructure. 
    Cloud services use a pay-as-you-go -OpEx- model. 
      Allowing businesses to pay only for what they use and deduct expenses in the same tax year.
    CapEx VS OpEx:
      OpEx -Operational Expenditure- refers to ongoing costs incurred in daily operations. 
        Such as cloud services, utilities, and salaries. 
        Can be deducted in the same tax year, providing flexibility based on usage. 
        Allows businesses to be more agile and responsive to changing needs.
      CapEx -Capital Expenditure- involves significant one-time investments in physical assets:
        Servers and data centers. 
          Which are depreciated over several years and represent long-term commitments. 
        Ties the businesses to fixed investments.
  Benefit from massive economies of scale:
    AWS aggregates usage across its large customer base. 
      Leveraging purchasing power to lower costs.
        Which are passed on to customers as lower variable costs.
  Stop guessing capacity:
    Cloud computing allows businesses to adjust capacity based on actual demand. 
      Eliminating the problem of over-provisioning and wasted resources.
  Increase speed and agility:
    AWS enables rapid deployment of resources via API calls, command line, or console. 
      Allowing companies to quickly: 
        Respond to changes.
        Compete by bringing products to market faster.
  Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers:
    AWS encourages businesses to focus on innovation rather than maintaining data centers. 
      As it doesn't add value to the business or provide competitive advantage.
  Go global in minutes:
    AWS allows businesses to deploy resources globally with ease. 
      Something that was traditionally complex and time-consuming.

Cloud Computing: Deployment Models
  Private Cloud: 
    Infrastructure is hosted in your own data center. 
    Giving organizations complete control over hardware, software, and security. 
    It requires software layers -from VMware, Microsoft, Red Hat- to manage the cloud environment. 
      Offering customized and secure solutions -Provide some cloud management software-.
    Though AWSâ€™s public cloud security is often hard to match in this cases since it's complex.
  Public Cloud: 
    Offered by third-party providers -AWS, Azure, Google Cloud-. 
    The public cloud is accessible to multiple users. 
    It provides elasticity, operational expenditures -OpEx- instead of -CapEx-. 
    While generally cost-efficient, private clouds may still be cheaper for specific workloads.
  Hybrid Cloud: 
    Connects private and public clouds, allow organization to run application in both environments. 
    Move data and services between infrastructures by VPNs or private links -AWS Direct Connect-.
      Giving flexibility for application deployment and scalability.
    Allow us to keep the critical apps and sensitive data in out data center.
  Multicloud: 
    Involves using multiple cloud services -public and/or private- from different providers. 
    This approach allows organizations to choose the best cloud for specific applications. 
      Increases complexity, which may impact security and operational efficiency.
AWS Global Infrastructure & Shared Responsibility Model
  AWS Regions: 
    Each region is a geographic area that contains multiple Availability Zones -AZs-.
      AZs physically separate to ensure fault tolerance and disaster recovery.
      From 3 to 6.
    Designed for high availability, scalability, and low latency.
    Most AWS services are region-scoped.
    The Service availability and the Pricing vary from region to other.
  Availability Zones -AZs-: 
    Each AZ is made up of one or more data centers with redundant power, networking, and cooling.
  Data center:
    Secure, compliant, and equipped for scalability and redundancy.
  AWS Points of Presence -PoPs-: 
    Separate from data centers and AZs. 
    Points of Presence include Edge Locations and Regional Caches. 
      Reduce latency and improve performance for users globally.
      AWS uses for content delivery -like with Amazon CloudFront-.
      Delivering data closer to the end users.
      +400 Edge Locations.
  Shared Responsibility Model: 
    Model referring to protection of your cloud computing resources. 
    Whose responsibility is shared between you -customer- and AWS.
      AWS secures the underlying cloud infrastructure. 
      Customers are responsible for securing their data, applications, and access within the cloud.
    Both parties collaborate to ensure a secure, compliant environment.
Characteristics and Cloud Computing:
  5 Characteristics of Cloud Computing:
    On-demand self-service: 
      Users can provision resources independently without interacting with the provider.
    Broad network access: 
      Resources are available over the network, accessible across various platforms.
    Multi-tenancy and resource pooling: 
      Multiple customers securely share the same infrastructure, optimizing resource usage.
    Rapid elasticity and scalability: 
      Resources can be quickly scaled up or down based on demand.
    Measured service: 
      Resource usage is tracked, and users are charged based on their consumption.
        Insuring cost efficiency.
  Private cloud Vs On-premises:
    A private cloud can be on-premises, but it doesn't have to be. Here's the distinction:
      Private Cloud:
        Definition: 
          Cloud environment dedicated to a single customer.
          Offering the same scalability, elasticity, and self-service features as public cloud.
            But in an isolated infrastructure.
        Where It Runs:
          On-Premises: 
            Hosted in the company's own data centers.
          Third-Party Hosted: 
            A cloud provider like AWS, VMware, or IBM. 
              Runs and manages the private cloud for the customer in their data centers.
          Key Features: 
            Virtualized resources, automation, and flexibilityâ€”similar to a public cloud.
      On-Premises:
        Definition: 
          IT infrastructure physically located at the customerâ€™s site. 
            Without the features of cloud computing, like: 
              Automation, elasticity, or self-service capabilities.
        Where It Runs: 
          Always in the companyâ€™s own data centers.
        Key Features: 
          Usually relies on static infrastructure, with manual provisioning and scaling.
    Private cloud: 
      Can run on-premises but itâ€™s more advanced than traditional on-premises infrastructure. 
        Because it incorporates cloud-like features:
          Scalability, automation, and self-service. 
        Examples:
          AWS Outposts.
            AWS Service. 
            Allows customers to extend their AWS infrastructure into their on-premises DC. 
            Run workloads with the same APIs and services as in AWS data centers.
              But with dedicated hardware.
      Can be hosted off-premises by a provider while remaining dedicated to one customer.
        EC2 Dedicated Host.
          EC2 instances to run on physically isolated hardware dedicated to them. 
            But still in AWS data centers.
