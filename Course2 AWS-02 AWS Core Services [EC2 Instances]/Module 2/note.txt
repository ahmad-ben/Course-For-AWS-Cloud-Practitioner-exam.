  AWS Right Sizing
    Selecting the most powerful isn't always the best due to the cloud's elasticity.
    Right sizing involves: 
      Matching instance types and sizes to workload requirements for optimal performance and cost.
      Reviewing deployed instances. 
        To find opportunities for downsizing without compromising capacity, reducing costs.
    Scaling up is easy, so it's advisable to start with smaller instances.
    It's crucial to right size: 
      Before migration. 
      After onboarding continuously, as requirements change.
    Tools can assist in right sizing:
      CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor, and third-party tools..
Amazon EC2 Pricing Options:
  Summary of the Amazon EC2 pricing options:
    On-Demand: 
      Flexible and straightforward with no commitments. 
      Ideal for short-term or unpredictable workloads.
    Reserved Instances -RI-: 
      Discounted -up to 75%- for committing to one or three years. 
      Suitable for steady-state applications -predictable-. 
      We can also reserve capacity with Reserved Instances as well.
      Offers options like: 
        Standard -limited modifications-.
          AZ, Instance size in Linux, Networking type. 
        Convertible -more flexibility to change attributes-. 
          AZ, Instance size in Linux, Networking type, family, OS, payment option. 
      Payment options include all upfront, partial upfront, or no upfront.
        upfront having the best discount, but no suitable for cash flow and vice versa. 
      Instance attributes should match the attributes of reserved instance to see discounts, like:
        Type of instance you're running, operating system, The tenancy, AZ and the region.
      When you specify an AZ, you can also reserve capacity in it, but not by region.
    Spot Instances: 
      Offers up to 90% discounts by bidding for unused capacity but can be interrupted by AWS. 
      Ideal for flexible workloads that can handle interruptions.
      We have three types:
        Spot instance: One or more spot instances.
        Spot fleet: 
          AWS launches and maintains a specified number of spot instances. 
            You can be mix in on-demand instances to meet a certain capacity. 
        EC2 fleet: 
          AWS launches and maintains a specified number of spot, on-demand, and reserved instances. 
            All in a single API call. 
          You can define a lot of setting here, it's very flexible.
    Dedicated Instances: 
      Guarantees physical hardware isolation from other AWS customers, charging per instance.
      Your instance is moved around on different physical servers.
        Whichever is not occupied by others at the time.
    Dedicated Hosts: 
      Provides a whole physical server for customer use, paid per host. 
      Suitable for workloads needing hardware-specific licensing or core visibility.
      It's always the same physical machine for as long as you are paying.
    Dedicated Instances and Dedicated Hosts:
      Both use physical servers, but:
        Dedicated Instances share hardware among your instances.
        Dedicated Hosts provide complete exclusivity and control over a physical server. 
    Savings Plans: 
      Allows consistent usage discounts across EC2, Fargate, and Lambda.
        With one or three year commitments.
      There are two types:
        Compute Savings Plan: 
          Covers Fargate, Lambda, and EC2 across any region, family, size, tenancy, and OS.
          EC2 Savings Plan: 
            Specifically for EC2 with hourly usage. 
              Applicable within a selected region and instance family. 
              Allows any size, tenancy, and operating system combination.
    Spot Block: 
      Enables a fixed duration -1 to 6 hours- for Spot Instances, discounted but non-interruptible.
        30% to 45% less then On-demand, less than Spot Instances but without interruption.
