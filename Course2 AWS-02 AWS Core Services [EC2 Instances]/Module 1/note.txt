Introduction:
  What we will learn:
    What is EC2: 
      Stands for -Elastic Compute Cloud-. 
      AWS's essential service for scalable compute resources.
    Discover instance types like:
      General purpose, compute optimized, memory optimized, and storage optimized. 
    Topics cover: 
      Instance launching.
      Configuration.
      Security with security groups and key pairs, and using user data scripts. 
    Gain skills for effective EC2 instance deployment and management. 
      To meet various workload needs.
Introduction to Amazon EC2:
  Amazon EC2 -Elastic Compute Cloud-: 
    Key AWS service offering infrastructure as a service, essential for cloud understanding.
  EC2 Components:
    Virtual Machines: 
      Also called EC2 Instances, configurable to match workload needs.
    Storage: 
      Options include network-attached EBS and hardware-attached instance storage.
        EBS -Elastic Block Store-:
          EBS Volumes are independent storage units. 
          Attached to an EC2 instance over AWS's network.
    Load Balancing: 
      Elastic Load Balancer for distributing load across instances.
        distributes various types of load, like app traffic, network traffic and database Load.
    Auto-Scaling:
      Auto Scaling Groups -ASG- for adjusting resource use based on demand.
  Instance Customization:
    Operating System:
      Linux or Windows options available.
    Compute Power:
      Configurable CPU, RAM, and storage.
    Network Settings:
      Flexible network options with fast, public IP.
    Security:
      Control access with security groups and firewall rules.
    Bootstrapping:
      Use EC2 User Data for startup configuration.
  Instance Types Examples:
    Range from T2 Micro (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM) to:
      Larger types like C5 and M5. with more vCPUs, memory, and network speed.
  AWS Free Tier: 
    T2 Micro instance provides 750 hours/month for a year.
  Flexibility and On-Demand Use: 
    Easily choose and deploy instances suited to specific application needs.
  What is the different between EC2 and EC2 Instance:
    EC2 -Elastic Compute Cloud-: 
      The overall AWS service that provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud.
    EC2 Instance:
      Virtual server you create within EC2.
      Customized with specific configurations like -CPU, memory, storage- to run applications.
    EC2 is the service, and an EC2 instance is an individual virtual machine within that service.
Introduction to Amazon EC2:
  What are Amazon EC2 Instances?
    A virtual server in the AWS Cloud. 
    The instance type of the launching EC2 instance determines its hardware available.
    Allows users to rent virtual servers -known as instances-. 
      On which they can run their own applications.
    Each instance type offers a different balance of: 
      Compute, memory, network, and storage resources.
    Infrastructure as a Service
  Amazon EC2 Capabilities:
    Offers a wide range of instance types optimized for various use cases, such as: 
      General-purpose computing, memory-intensive workloads, and GPU processing.
    Renting virtual machines -EC2-.
    Storing data on virtual drives -EBS-.
    Distributing load across machines -ELB-.
    Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group -ASG-.
    Provides flexibility to scale compute capacity up or down based on demand. 
      Enabling cost optimization and performance scalability.
    Supports a variety of operating systems and software configurations. 
      Allowing users to customize their computing environment according to their requirements.
    Widely used for: 
      Hosting websites, running applications, performing data processing tasks, and more.. 
        Making it a fundamental component of cloud computing.
  User Data Script
    EC2 instances can be configured at launch using User Data scripts.
    Bootstrapping refers to executing commands upon a machine's startup.
    The User Data script executes only once during the initial startup of the instance.
    EC2 User Data is utilized for automating startup tasks, including:
      Installing updates.
      Installing software.
      Downloading files from the internet.
      Any other tasks you might require..
      It creates a server and static web page when the EC2 instance is first created.
