  About Amazon Virtual Private Cloud -VPC-: 
    A core AWS service that allows you to create a customizable virtual network in the cloud. 
  By mastering VPC:
    You will gain the skills needed to architect robust and reliable cloud solutions. 
      Tailored to your organization's needs.
Understanding Amazon Virtual Private Cloud -VPC-:
  What is VPC:
    Logically isolated portion of the AWS cloud within a region, dedicated to your account.
      You cannot create a VPC that spans multiple Regions directly.
    We can say it's your data center in the AWS.
    Isolated area that you can create your resources in. 
    Private and secured and controlled by you.
    You can create multiple VPCs within a region, up to 5.
    In each VPC we can create one or more subnets.
    Each VPC has an IP address range you should specify known as the VPC address block. 
      Defined using CIDR notation like 10.0.0.0/16.
        CIDR: 
          Stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
          Method for allocating IP addresses and routing.
      This address block provides the pool of IP addresses. 
        Can be allocated to subnets within the VPC.
  What are Subnets:
    Subdivisions within a VPC.
      Enable you to isolate resources within different -AZs- in the same Region. 
    They can be classified as public or private subnets based on their internet accessibility.
    Required to host resources like EC2 instances within a VPC.
    Each subnet in AWS is specific to a single Availability Zone.
    We an have multiple subnets in the same AZ.
    Each subnet created within the VPC takes a portion of the VPC address block. 
      For example a subnet might use 10.0.1.0/24 if the VPC is 10.0.0.0/16. 
        Subnets are restricted to a single AZ. 
          Enabling finer control over IP distribution and redundancy.
  Public Subnets:
    The EC2 instances in this subnet have a public IP address that can be found on the internet.
  Private Subnets:
    The EC2 instances in this subnet will get a private address.
      So these instances can't be accessed from the internet.  
  Instances in the Subnets:
    Each instance launched within a subnet is assigned an IP address from that subnet's range. 
      Either automatically or manually. 
        This IP falls within the VPC address block, ensuring network consistency.
  How Connectivity Works in a VPC:
    Each VPC has an invisible VPC router that manages the routing of traffic within the VPC. 
      You don't directly interact with the VPC router, you control its behavior by a route table.
        The route table defines rules for how traffic should be directed, for example:
          If two EC2 instances in the same VPC need to communicate. 
            They can do so internally. 
            Both instances have IP private addresses within the VPC's IP range. 
              Allowing direct, local routing without leaving the VPC.
          To connect to the outside world, you need an Internet Gateway:
            It is attached to the VPC. 
              Acts as the access point for traffic between the VPC and the broader internet.
            For external traffic.
              Any address not within the VPC's IP range will be directed to the Internet Gateway.
            It sits at the edge of the VPC. 
              Managing all inbound and outbound traffic to and from the internet.
    This setup allows secure, controlled communication within the VPC and with external resources.
  Internet gateways Types:
    Internet Gateway -IGW- is for IPv4.
    Egress-Only Internet Gateway -IGW- is for IPv6.
  Peering connection is a connection between two VPCs.
  VPC Endpoint: 
    Provides a private connection to AWS service.
      Without requiring traffic to traverse the public Internet. 
    Communication happens directly within the AWS network, enhancing security and reducing latency.
    In standard configurations: 
      Traffic would go through the VPC router and then the Internet Gateway. 
        To access AWS public services. 
  AWS Direct Connect: 
    Network service. 
    Establish a dedicated line from your on-premises data center or office to AWS.
    Provides a dedicated, private connection between on-premises data center and AWS. 
      It bypasses the public Internet, allowing for more secure and reliable connectivity.
  Security Group
    A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances.
    Control inbound and outbound traffic.
    Functionality:   
      Operates at the instance level.
      Uses stateful rules, meaning: 
        If you allow inbound traffic, the corresponding outbound traffic is automatically allowed.
      Specify rules based on IP protocols, port numbers, and source/destination IP addresses.
    Ideal for controlling access to instances.
      Defining which traffic is permitted or denied based on specific criteria.
  Network ACL -Access Control List-:
    Layer of security.
    Acts as a firewall for controlling traffic to and from subnets within your VPC.
    Functionality:   
      Operates at the subnet level.
      Uses stateless rules.
        Meaning that you need to define rules for both inbound and outbound traffic separately.
      Allow or deny traffic based on IP protocol, port number, and source/destination IP addresses.
    Useful for setting broader network-level access rules.
      Providing an additional layer of security for your VPC.
  Virtual Private Cloud: An Introduction
  Introduction to VPC & Subnets:
    VPC is Virtual Private Cloud; private network to deploy your resources -regional resource-.
    Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC -Availability Zone resource-.
    A public subnet is a subnet that is accessible from the internet.
    A private subnet is a subnet that is not accessible from the internet.
    To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use route tables.
    IP Addresses in AWS, useful not tested information!
      Public IPv4: Usable on the internet. 
        By default in every stop-start cycle an EC2 instance is assigned to a new public IPv4 add.
      Private IPv4: Used within private networks -LAN-, such as internal AWS networks.
        For example 192.168.1.1. 
      Private IPv4 addresses remain constant for EC2 instances, even when stopped and restarted. 
      Elastic IP: 
        Provides a static public IPv4 address that can be associated with an EC2 instance. 
      Pricing: AWS charges $0.005 per hour for all public IPv4 addresses, including Elastic IPs. 
        Free Tier includes 750 hours of usage per month. 
      IPv6: Internet Protocol Version 6 -Approximately 340 Undecillion Addresses-.
        All IP addresses are public in AWS -there are no private ranges-. 
        Example Address: 2001:db8:3333:4444:cccc:dddd:eeee:ffff 
        No charge for usage.
  Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways:
    Internet Gateways enables internet connectivity for instances in a VPC.
      Public Subnets are configured with a route to the Internet Gateway for external access.
    NAT Gateways -managed by AWS- and NAT Instances -managed by the user- 
      Provide internet access to instances in Private Subnets while keeping them private.
  Network ACL & Security Groups:
    NACL -Network Access Control List-:
      Acts as a firewall controlling traffic to and from a subnet.
      Supports both ALLOW and DENY rules.
      Attached at the subnet level.
      Rules are based solely on IP addresses.
    Security Groups:
      A firewall.
      Controls traffic to and from an Elastic Network Interface -ENI- or an EC2 instance.
      Only ALLOW rules are supported.
      Rules can include IP addresses and other security groups.
VPC Connections
  VPC Peering
    Allows two VPCs to connect privately using AWS network.
      Making them behave as if they were in the same network.
    It requires that the VPCs have non-overlapping CIDR blocks -IP address ranges-.
      Both VPCs should not have the same IP address ranges. 
      The IP address ranges used in each VPC should be distinct.
        Avoiding routing conflicts and ensure proper communication between the VPCs. 
      For example: 
        If one VPC uses the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16, the other VPC might use 192.168.0.0/16. 
          Ensuring that the two ranges do not overlap.
    VPC Peering connections are not transitive.
      A direct connection must be established for each pair of VPCs that need to communicate.
      Example:
        VPC A initiates the request. 
        VPC B accepts it. 
        Both VPCs need to configure their route tables and security settings. 
          To enable communication.
  VPC Endpoints
    Enable private network connections to AWS services. 
      Bypassing the public internet for enhanced security and lower latency.
    VPC Endpoint Gateway is used for S3 and DynamoDB.
    VPC Endpoint Interface is used for other AWS services.
  AWS PrivateLink -VPC Endpoint Services-:
    The most secure and scalable way to expose a service to thousands of VPCs. 
      Without requiring VPC peering, internet gateways, NAT devices, or route tables.
    It requires:
      Network Load Balancer -NLB- in the service VPC.
        The Network Load Balancer is a load balancing service. 
          Directs traffic to the service instances in the Service VPC.
        The Service VPC is the VPC hosting the service.
      Elastic Network Interface -ENI- in the customer VPC.
        The Customer VPC is the VPC that connects to the service -the client-.
        Elastic Network Interface is a virtual network interface in the customer VPC.
          It enables access to the service.
    You don't need a separate NLB for each VPC. 
    You need a separate NLB one for the service itself in the Service VPC. 
      Each customer VPC that connects will have its own ENI for secure access.
  Site-to-Site VPN:
    Connects an on-premises VPN to AWS.
    Type of VPN connection.
    The connection is automatically encrypted.
    Traffic goes over the public internet.
    On-premises: must use a Customer Gateway -CGW-
      Physical/Software appliance located on the on-premises side of a Site-to-Site VPN connection.
    AWS: must use a Virtual Private Gateway -VGW-.
      Virtual router on the AWS side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.
  Direct Connect:
    Establishes a physical connection between on-premises and AWS.
    The connection is private, secure, and fast.
    Traffic goes over a private network.
    Takes at least a month to establish.
  AWS Client VPN:
    AWS Client VPN -using OpenVPN-.
    Allows you to connect from your computer to your private network in AWS and on-premises.
    Enables you to connect to your EC2 instances over a private IP. 
      As if you were in the private VPC network.
    The connection goes over the public internet.
  Transit Gateway:
    Provides transitive peering between thousands of VPCs and on-premises networks. 
      Using a hub-and-spoke -star- connection.
    Utilizes a single gateway to offer this functionality.
    Compatible with Direct Connect Gateway and VPN connections.
