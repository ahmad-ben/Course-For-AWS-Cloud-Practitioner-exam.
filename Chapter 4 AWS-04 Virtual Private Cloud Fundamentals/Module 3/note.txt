Summary -Virtual Private Cloud Summary-:
  VPC -Virtual Private Cloud-is a private network within the AWS cloud.
  Subnets are partitions of a VPC tied to an Availability Zone -AZ-.
  Internet Gateway provides internet access at the VPC level.
  NAT Gateway/Instances allow private subnets to access the internet.
  NACL -Network Access Control List-: 
    Stateless rules for inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
  Security Groups: 
    Stateful rules that operate at the EC2 instance level or Elastic Network Interface -ENI-.
  VPC Peering connects two VPCs with non-overlapping IP ranges; non-transitive.
  Elastic IP is Aa fixed public IPv4 address with ongoing costs if not in use.
  VPC Endpoints provide private access to AWS Services within VPC.
  PrivateLink privately connect to a service in a 3rd party VPC.
  VPC Flow Logs are network traffic logs.
  Site to Site VPN is a VPN over public internet between on-premises DC and AWS.
  Client VPN by an OpenVPN connection from your computer into your VPC.
  Direct Connect is a direct private connection to AWS.
  Transit Gateway connect thousands of VPC and on-premises networks together.

    Quiz Q&A:
      Q1:
        The question:
          What is the function of the Amazon VPC Endpoint?
        Options:
          To establish a secure connection between VPCs.
          To provide internet access to instances within a VPC.
          To enable communication between resources in a VPC and AWS services 
            without traversing the public internet. ✔️
          To manage access control lists -ACLs- for subnets within a VPC.
      Q2:
        The question:
          How does Amazon VPC peering differ from VPN connections?
        Options:
          VPC peering connects two VPCs within the same region, 
          while VPN connections connect a VPC to an external network. ✔️
          VPC peering requires additional hardware, while VPN connections are software-based.
          VPC peering is limited to connecting VPCs in different regions, 
          while VPN connections can only connect VPCs within the same region.
          VPC peering is a one-to-many connection, while VPN connections are one-to-one.
      Q3:
        The question:
          Which components are required 
          to build a successful site-to-site VPC connection on AWS? -Choose two.-
        Options:
          Customer gateway. ✔️ Manara potential error ❌ 
            "Even i chose the 2 correct answers they didn't accept it, 
            maybe they still don't accept two answers and just pick one."
          Virtual private gateway. ✔️
          Internet gateway.
          A&B.
      Q4:
        The question:
          Which Amazon Virtual Private Cloud -Amazon VPC- feature 
          enables users to connect two VPCs together?
        Options:
          Amazon VPC endpoints.
          Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud -Amazon EC2- ClassicLink.
          Amazon VPC peering. ✔️
          AWS Direct Connect.
      Q5:
        The question:
          A company requires an isolated environment within AWS for security purposes. 
          Which action can be taken to accomplish this?
        Options:
          Create a separate Availability Zone to host the resources.
          Create a separate VPC to host the resources. ✔️
          Create a placement group to host the resources.
          Create an AWS Direct Connect connection between the company and AWS.
      Q6:
        The question:
          Which AWS service enables users to securely connect to AWS resources 
          over the public internet?
        Options:
          Amazon VPC peering.
          AWS Direct Connect.
          AWS VPN. ✔️
          Amazon Pinpoint.

      Q7:
        The question:
          How does Amazon VPC differ from traditional network infrastructure?
        Options:
          VPCs are managed entirely by AWS, while traditional networks are managed on-premises.
          VPCs are more expensive to set up and maintain than traditional networks.
          VPCs offer more flexibility and scalability compared to traditional networks. ✔️
          VPCs are limited in terms of bandwidth and latency compared to traditional networks.
      Q8:
        The question:
          What is the purpose of security groups in Amazon VPC?
        Options:
          To control traffic at the subnet level.
          To provide granular control over network ACLs.
          To filter inbound and outbound traffic to instances. ✔️
          To establish VPN connections between VPCs.
      Q9:
        The question:
          What is the function of a Network ACL -Access Control List- in Amazon VPC?
        Options:
          To control traffic at the subnet level. ✔️
          To filter inbound and outbound traffic to instances.
          To provide granular control over network security groups.
          To establish VPN connections between VPCs.
