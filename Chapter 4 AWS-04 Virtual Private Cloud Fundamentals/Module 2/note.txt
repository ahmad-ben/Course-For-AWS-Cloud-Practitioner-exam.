Introduction:
  what we will learn:
    Discover network monitoring tools and techniques.
      For gaining visibility into the performance and health of your VPC. 
    How to use:
      AWS CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs, and third-party monitoring solutions. 
        To monitor network traffic, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot connectivity issues. 
  By implementing effective network monitoring strategies.
    You'll be able to proactively identify and address potential network-related issues.
      Ensuring the reliability and availability of your cloud infrastructure.
Network Monitoring:
  VPC Flow Logs: 
    Feature provided by AWS.  
    Within this feature, you have three options for granularity:
      VPC Flow Logs: 
        The broadest scope, covering all traffic in the VPC.
        High-level overview of all traffic in the VPC, but lacks detail for specific resources.
      Subnet Flow Logs: 
        More focused than VPC logs.
        Tracks traffic within a specific subnet.
          Giving you better clarity for that part of your architecture.  
      Elastic Network Interface -ENI- Flow Logs: 
        The most granular, targeting a specific network interface.  
        Very detailed and focused on traffic to/from a specific network interface, for example: 
          Tied to an EC2 instance.  
          Tied to a service like a Load Balancer.  
    Data Destination:  
      Regardless of which level you choose, the logs can be sent to: 
        Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3 or Amazon Kinesis, allowing for analysis and storage.
    Enabling All The Three Options Simultaneously?
      Yes, you can enable all three options simultaneously. Each log operates independently:
        Enable VPC Flow Logs to monitor the overall traffic.  
        Simultaneously enable Subnet Flow Logs for specific subnets where you need more visibility.  
        At the same time, turn on ENI Flow Logs for critical resources, for example:
          An EC2 instance running sensitive workloads.  
  How do you monitor the network:
    VPC Flow Logs, Subnet Flow Logs, Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs. 
      Features you can enable on your VPC resources to capture and analyze network traffic. 
        Aiding in troubleshooting and monitoring network connectivity and security.
      Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces. 
        Aiding in monitoring and troubleshooting connectivity issues, such as:
          Subnets to the internet.
          Subnets to subnets.
          Internet to subnets.
      They also capture network information from AWS managed interfaces like: 
        Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, and Aurora.
  VPC Flow Logs data can be sent to S3, CloudWatch Logs, and Kinesis Data Firehose.
    For analysis and storage.
