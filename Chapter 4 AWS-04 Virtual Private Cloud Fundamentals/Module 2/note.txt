Introduction:
  what we will learn:
    Discover network monitoring tools and techniques.
      For gaining visibility into the performance and health of your VPC. 
    How to use:
      AWS CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs, and third-party monitoring solutions. 
        To monitor network traffic, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot connectivity issues. 
  By implementing effective network monitoring strategies.
    You'll be able to proactively identify and address potential network-related issues.
      Ensuring the reliability and availability of your cloud infrastructure.
Network Monitoring:
  How do you monitor the network:
    VPC Flow Logs, Subnet Flow Logs, Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs. 
      Features you can enable on your VPC resources to capture and analyze network traffic. 
        Aiding in troubleshooting and monitoring network connectivity and security.
      Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces. 
        Aiding in monitoring and troubleshooting connectivity issues, such as:
          Subnets to the internet.
          Subnets to subnets.
          Internet to subnets.
      They also capture network information from AWS managed interfaces like: 
        Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, and Aurora.
  VPC Flow Logs data can be sent to S3, CloudWatch Logs, and Kinesis Data Firehose.
    For analysis and storage.
