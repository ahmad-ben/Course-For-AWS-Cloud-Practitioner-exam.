Sharing Your Resources in AWS
  AWS Organizations
    AWS management service. 
    It enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an -organization-. 
      That you create and centrally manage. 
    It includes account management and consolidated billing capabilities.
      Enable you to better meet the budgetary, security, and compliance needs of your business.
    Manages multiple AWS accounts. 
    Acts as the central master account.
    Cost Benefits -Consolidated Billing-:
      Single payment method across all accounts.
      Discounts from aggregated usage of some services like  EC2, S3.
      Reserved Instance Pooling:
        Optimal savings with pooled EC2 instances.
        If you purchase a Reserved Instance under the master account or any linked account: 
          The discounted pricing can be shared across all accounts in the organization.
          Other accounts can use the RI pricing benefit if: 
            They launch EC2 instances that match the RI specifications, like:
              instance type, region, etc.
    Automation:
      Automate AWS account creation and management via APIs.
    Control Access: 
      Restrict account privileges using Service Control Policies -SCP-.
      Set guardrails to restrict or allow specific actions across accounts for governance.
  Multi Account Strategies:
    Create separate accounts for each department, cost center, and environment -dev/test/prod-.
    Implement Service Control Policies -SCP- for regulatory compliance.
    Use VPCs for resource isolation within each account.
    Manage separate service limits for each account.
      Service Limits: 
        Setting and managing the maximum resources or services that each AWS account can use.
      In a multi-account setup, you can control the limits of each account separately.
      For example:
        Department A's AWS account may be allowed to launch only 10 EC2 instances.
        Department B's account can launch 50 EC2 instances.
    Establish a dedicated logging account.
      An AWS Account that holds the data from all the other AWS accounts.
        By doing the following steps:  
          Establish the CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs in each account.
          Make all CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs send their data to the logging account. 
      Enable AWS CloudTrail in all accounts; direct logs to a central S3 bucket.
      Centralize CloudWatch Logs to a dedicated logging account.
    Choose between multi-account or single account with multiple VPCs based on needs.
    Standardize tagging for efficient billing management.
      What Standardized Tagging Does:
        Organizes Resources:
          Help identify the purpose of a resource, for example:
            Environment:Test, Team:Marketing, or Project:AppX.
        Tracks Costs:
          Tags allow you to filter cost reports, for example:
            All Environment:Test resources cost $X this month.
        Improves Management:
          Tags help manage resources by identifying their owner, usage, or expiration, for example: 
            Owner:JohnDoe, Status:DecommissionSoon.
        Enables Automation:
          Automated scripts can use tags to perform actions, for example:
            Shutting down all Environment:Test resources after 6 PM.
  Organizational Units
    Within AWS Organizations you can simplify account management by: 
      Grouping related accounts into Organizational Units -OUs-. 
    Allowing for uniform policy administration and streamlined operations.
    Apply Policies Easily:
      Use Service Control Policies to enforce rules and restrictions across all accounts in an OU. 
        For example blocking access to specific services.
    Streamline Management:
      Makes it easier to manage multiple accounts by applying changes at the OU level. 
        Rather than individually.
    Useful whitepaper here: 
      https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_ous.html
  Service Control Policies -SCP-:
    Powerful feature of AWS Organizations.
    Allow you defining what AWS services and actions are allowed or denied across accounts and OUs.
    Whitelist or blacklist IAM actions.
      Whitelist: a way an SCP is written, Specify what is allowed; everything else is denied.
      Blacklist: a way an SCP is written, Specify what is denied; everything else is allowed.
    Applied at the OU or Account level, excluding the Master Account -management account-.
      The account that creates and manages the AWS Organization.
    Affects all Users and Roles, including the Root user.
      Overrides permissions, even for the root user -unlike IAM policies-.
    Does not impact service-linked roles.
      Service-linked roles: 
        AWS Identity and Access Management -IAM- roles that: 
          Predefined by AWS and directly.
          Associated with specific AWS services. 
        These roles allow AWS services to perform actions on your behalf in your AWS account.
        Key Characteristics:
          Predefined by AWS: 
            You don't need to manually create these roles. AWS creates and manages them for you.
          Service-Specific: 
            They are tied to a particular AWS service, such as EC2, RDS, or Lambda.
              Enable those services to function correctly.
          Automatically Managed: 
            AWS automatically creates, manages, and deletes these roles as needed.
          Limited Permissions: 
            Permissions granted to a service-linked role are only what the service requires.
              To perform its tasks.
        Examples of Use:
          EC2 Auto Scaling: 
            The role AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling. 
              Allows EC2 Auto Scaling to create or terminate instances.
          RDS: 
            The role AWSServiceRoleForRDS. 
              Lets Amazon RDS manage resources for tasks like backups or updates.
          CloudWatch: 
            The role AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatch. 
              Allows CloudWatch to read metrics or manage logs.
        Benefits:
          Simplified Management: 
            AWS automatically creates and attaches the required policies to the role.
          Security: 
            Permissions are scoped tightly, so the service can only perform necessary actions.
          Integration: 
            Services can seamlessly perform their operations without manual intervention.
        Real Scenario: 
          When you use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. 
          AWS might automatically create a service-linked role called AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling.
            To allow the service to manage EC2 instances on your behalf. 
          You don't need to manage its permissions, it's taken care of by AWS.
    SCPs must have explicit Allow rules.
      SCPs require that actions be explicitly allowed; otherwise, they're implicitly denied.
    Use cases include: 
      Restricting access to specific services.
        Block the use of RDS in all non-production accounts.
      Enforcing compliance standards, such as PCI.
        Example: Ensure only PCI-compliant regions and services are accessible.
          PCI stands for Payment card industry.
      Control Billing:
        Example: Prevent users from creating expensive resources like GPU EC2 instances.
  AWS Organizations -Consolidated Billing-:
    When activated, AWS Organizations offers consolidated billing, which allows for:
      Combined Usage: 
        Aggregates usage across all accounts within the organization. 
          Leveraging volume pricing, Reserved Instances, and Savings Plans discounts collectively.
            Examples of how Savings Plans can benefit an AWS Organization:
              Compute Savings Plans:
                Scenario: 
                  An organization has multiple accounts. 
                  The are using various EC2 instance families, sizes, and OS in a specific region.
                Benefit:
                  The Master account purchases a Compute Savings Plan with a 1/3 years commitment.
                  The discount applies across all EC2 instances used in the organization.
                    Since the instance usage matches the Savings Plan criteria for compute usage.
              EC2 Instance Savings Plans:
                Scenario: 
                  The organization uses a specific EC2 instance type for example m5.large. 
                  They use it heavily in a particular region across several accounts.
                Benefit:
                  The MA purchases an EC2 Instance Savings Plan for m5.large in us-east-1 region.
                  Any workload:
                    In the organization including the management account. 
                    Matches this instance type and region. 
                      Receives the discount.
            Key Points:
              Savings Plans are shared by default across all member accounts in the organization. 
                Unless the management account disables sharing.
              Discounts apply on a first-come, first-served basis.
              Discounts apply on accounts with matching workloads. 
                Until the commitment is fully utilized. 
              Remaining workloads are charged at standard rates.
      Single Bill: 
        Consolidated billing into one invoice for all AWS accounts within the organization.
      Control over Discounts: 
        The management account can disable the sharing of Reserved Instances discounts. 
          For any account within the organization, including itself.

        Direct Connect Attachment: 
          Provides connectivity between AWS and on-premises data centers via AWS Direct Connect. 
            Which bypasses the public internet for: 
              More secure, reliable, and high-performance connections.
        Peering Attachments:
          Used to connect two Transit Gateways across different AWS accounts or regions.
    Use Case:
      If a company has multiple VPCs in different AWS accounts or regions. 
      It can use a Transit Gateway with VPC Attachments.
        Ensure seamless communication between those VPCs. 
        Eliminating the need to set up individual peering connections between each pair of VPCs.
  AWS Resource Access Manager -AWS RAM-:

        Use Case Example:
          If an organization has multiple accounts. 
          The account with the Transit Gateway can: 
            Allow other accounts to attach their VPCs to the same Transit Gateway.
              Accounts within the organization.
          The account with the Transit Gateway would create the attachments. 
          Other accounts would use those attachments to connect their VPCs.
      Route 53 hosted zones.
        The practice of centralizing DNS management in one AWS account. 
          Then sharing access to it across other accounts within the same organization.

      S3 Infrequent Access.
      S3 One-Zone IA.
      S3 Intelligent Tiering.
      S3 Glacier.
      S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
    Pricing factors:
      Number and size of objects -tiered pricing based on volume-.
        Number of Objects: 
          S3 charges you based on how many objects you store, with no minimum storage size.
        Size of Objects: 
          Costs increase with the total size of stored objects.
        Tiered Pricing: 
          Discounts are applied as storage volume increases, for example: 
            The first 50 TB may cost more per GB than the next 450 TB.
      Number and type of requests.
        Type pf requests:
          PUT, COPY, POST, and LIST requests: Charged per request.
          GET and SELECT requests: Charged based on the number of requests and data returned.
            The amount of data retrieved from S3 storage for certain types of requests like: 
              GET, SELECT, or similar.
              For example:
                If you request a 1 GB object using a GET operation. 
                  You are charged for 1 GB of data retrieved.
                If you use the SELECT feature. 
                  S3 may scan a larger dataset but only return a subset of the data. 
                    You are charged for:
                      The data scanned for example scanning 100 GB.
                      The data returned to you for example 1 GB returned.
                This cost is: 
                  Distinct from storage costs.
                  Reflects the computational effort and bandwidth needed to retrieve the data.
          More intensive operations like analytics or processing may cost more.
      Data transfer OUT of the S3 region.
        Inbound Data -uploaded to S3- is free.
        Outbound Data -data sent out of the S3 region- 
          Incurs additional charges based on the volume and destination.

      Lifecycle transitions.
        Lifecycle Rules: 
          Automatically move objects between storage classes to save costs, for example: 
            From Standard to Glacier.
        Transition Costs: 
          Moving objects between classes incurs charges for the lifecycle transition itself.
      Similar service: 
        EFS -pay per use, offers infrequent access, and lifecycle rules-.
        Lifecycle Rules:
          Automatically transitions files to lower-cost tiers. 
            Reducing costs for less frequently accessed files for example:
              From EFS Standard to EFS Infrequent Access.
          Transition Costs: 
            Moving objects between classes Doesn't incur charges.
  Database Pricing -RDS-:

      Inbound is free.
      Outbound data transfer are tiered for volume discounts.
        Within the same AWS Region: 
          Communicating with other AWS services like EC2 instances within the same VPC is free.
        Incurs costs and follows tiered pricing, meaning: 
          The more data transferred, the lower the per-GB cost in higher tiers.
  Content Delivery -CloudFront Pricing-:
    Geographic Pricing Variation -Costs differ across various regions-.
    Based on the amount of data transferred out to viewers.
    Charges are aggregated for each edge location before billing.
