AWS Global Infrastructure Overview - Regions, Availability Zones, Edge Locations and more:
  Introduction:
    The AWS global infrastructure forms the foundation of AWS cloud services worldwide.
  Key Concepts:
    Regions:
      Independent, geographically distant physical locations.
      Connected via a high-bandwidth, redundant global network.
      Each region contains at least 3 Availability Zones -AZs-.
      Each region located within a single country. 
        Adheres to the specific legal, compliance, and regulatory requirements of the country.
    Availability Zones -AZs-:
      Clusters of one or more data centers with redundant power, cooling, and networking.
      Provide high availability and fault tolerance.
      Resources can be deployed across AZs for redundancy.
    Subnets:
      Created within one AZs and can be public or private.
      Support deployment of resources for high availability.
    Data centers:
      Each one has redundant power sources and redundant networking.
        Lot of redundancy for cooling, networking, and all resources the cloud services depend on.
  Specialized Zones:
    Local Zones: 
      Extend AWS services closer to end users for lower latency.
      Essentially data centers that AWS deploys in specific geographic locations. 
        Usually near major cities or areas with high demand for low-latency services.
      Bring AWS services closer to end users in specific cities or areas. 
        Where AWS doesn't have a full region.
      Contain a subset of essential AWS services, such as: 
        Compute -EC2-, storage -EBS-, and databases -RDS-. 
          Providing those services closer to the end users or devices that require them.
      While Local Zones are not full AWS regions, they are extensions of an AWS region. 
        They are connected to the parent region via the AWS global network. 
          This connection allows you to seamlessly access other services in the AWS region. 
      The key idea is to reduce network latency for latency-sensitive applications. 
        Position resources closer to end users without routing the traffic to a distant region.
    Outposts: 
      AWS service.
      Extension of the AWS cloud into your physical premises, providing a hybrid cloud environment.
      Run AWS services and infrastructure in your on-premises data center.
        The services are running on AWS hardware that you manage in your own environment. 
          Rather than on AWS's cloud data centers.
      Bring AWS infrastructure -hardware and services-. 
        Directly into your on-premises data center or edge locations.
      It is suitable for:
        Apps that have latency, residency, or data locality requirements. 
          Can't be met by a remote AWS region.
    Wavelength Zones: 
      AWS service.
      AWS infrastructure exist in the communication service provider -csp-. 
      Relocating AWS Services to the Edge of Telecom Networks:
        AWS compute resources like EC2.. are deployed at the edge of telecom networks. 
          Instead of being located in centralized AWS regions they are placed closer to user. 
            At or near the telecom network's edge -telecom providers infrastructure-. 
            This placement minimizes latency, providing faster access to AWS services for users.
      Enabling Users to Connect via 5G Networks:
        Leverages 5G networks to connect end users to AWS services. 
          Since it has low latency and are designed to support high-speed, real-time applications. 
        Enables end users devices -mobile/IoT- to interact with AWS resources directly over 5G. 
          Creating a fast and responsive experience for applications requiring low-latency access.
      Leverage 5G networks to deliver single-digit millisecond latency. 
        For mobile and edge use cases like live video, machine learning, AR and VR.
  CloudFront:
    AWS Service for Content Delivery Network -CDN-.
    Caches data closer to users for faster access.
    Reduces latency for tasks like video streaming and image delivery.
    CloudFront Network -entire infrastructure Amazon CloudFront uses to deliver content-:
      Regional Edge Caches:
        Larger caches located in major AWS regions -typically in large cities or data hubs-.
        Cache less time-sensitive content compared to Edge Locations. 
          But still aim to reduce latency for content that isn’t required instantly.
        For content that can accept higher latency and is cached for longer periods. 
          Still improving performance, but it's not as urgent. 
        Could store things like: 
          Large media files or heavy static content that doesn't change as often.
      Edge Locations: 
        smaller data centers designed for caching highly-requested content.
        Primary purpose is to serve content as quickly as possible to end users.
        Placed in locations closer to end users.
          To deliver content like images, videos, and static files.
  General Notes:
    AWS global infrastructure is constantly expanding. 
      With changing numbers of regions, AZs, and edge locations.
    Understanding basic concepts is sufficient; memorizing exact numbers is unnecessary.
AWS Global Infrastructure A Deep Dive:
  Global application:
    Application deployed in multiple geographies.
    We use global infrastructure for:
      Decreased latency:
        Deploy your applications closer to your users. 
      Disaster Recovery:
        If an AWS region goes down -earthquake, storms, etc-, can fail-over to another region. 
          Having your application still working. 
      Attack protection: 
        Distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack, and that because:
          Redundancy: 
            Multiple regions and AZ. 
              It difficult to impact the entire system. 
              If one part is attacked, others can continue functioning.
          Decentralization: 
            Infrastructure spread across different locations, there's no single point of failure.
          Traffic Distribution: 
            Traffic can be distributed across various locations. 
              Making it harder for attackers to target a specific point effectively.
  AWS Infrastructure:
    Regions:
      Geographical locations around the world where AWS has data centers. 
      Each region is a separate geographic area with multiple availability zones.
    Availability Zones -AZs-:
      Isolated locations within AWS regions. 
      Engineered to be operationally independent of each other. 
      They have their own power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.
    They provide redundancy and fault tolerance.
  Edge Locations:
    Locations around the world to cache copies of data closer to users for faster access.
Learn Amazon Route53 - Beginner Overview of the AWS DNS service:
  What is DNS:
    Stands for Domain Name System.
    Translates human-friendly domain names like -example.com- into IP addresses. 
      For network communication.
    Helps systems communicate over the internet, as devices use IP addresses, not domain names.
  Amazon Route 53: 
    AWS's DNS -Domain Name System- service.
    Integrates with AWS services like: 
      CloudFront and load balancers for optimized traffic routing and high availability.
    Maps domain names to resources like EC2 instances within AWS.
    When a user tries to visit a website: 
      Their device queries a DNS resolver to find the corresponding IP address.
      If the resolver doesn't have the IP, it may asks Route 53 for the mapping.
    Routing policies: 
      Control how traffic is directed to different resources. Some key policies include:
        Geolocation Routing: 
          Directs users to different resources based on their geographic location.
            using their IP address.
        Latency Routing: 
          Sends traffic to the region with the lowest latency for the user.
        Weighted Routing: 
          Distributes traffic across multiple resources based on specified weights.
        Failover Routing: 
          Routes traffic to a primary resource.
            Automatically shifts to a secondary if the primary fails.
Global Applications in AWS:
  DNS:
    A system of rules and records that helps clients reach a server via URLs.
  What are Health Checks in Route 53:
    Used to monitor the availability and performance of your resources like web servers or apps. 
    Health Checks ensure only healthy resources receive traffic.
  AWS Route53
    Highly available and scalable Domain Name System -DNS- web service. 
    Connects user requests to internet applications running on AWS or on-premises.
    Routing Policies -Methods controlling how traffic is directed to resources based on criteria-:
      Simple routing policy:
        Does not require health checks. 
        Simply directs all traffic to a single resource or distributes it.
          Without checking its status.
      Weighted Routing: 
        Can use health checks.
        Distributes traffic across multiple resources based on weight values you assign. 
          Allowing you to control the proportion of traffic sent to each resource.
      Latency-Based Routing: 
        Uses health checks.
        Routes traffic to the resource with the lowest latency from the user's location. 
          Optimizing performance for end users.
      Failover Routing: 
        Requires health checks.
        Automatically directs traffic to a standby resource in the event of a failure or outage. 
          Ensuring high availability.
  Origin Access Control -OAC- and Origin Access Identity -OAI-: 
    Mechanisms of secure. 
    Secure access to an Amazon S3 bucket used as the origin for a CloudFront distribution. 
    Ensuring content is accessed only through CloudFront and not directly.
      Blocking direct public access to the bucket.
    Key Difference:
      OAI: 
        Older Mechanisms, Basic mechanism limited to S3 buckets.
      OAC: 
        Newer Mechanisms, More secure and feature-rich successor. 
        Compatible with modern AWS security standards and offering broader functionality.
      Usage in CloudFront Distributions -configuration of the CloudFront service-:
        Configure OAC or OAI to ensure your S3 bucket is not publicly accessible.
        All requests to the bucket must go through CloudFront.
          Providing an additional layer of security and control.
  AWS CloudFront:
    Content delivery network -CDN-, service. 
    Built for high performance, security, and developer convenience.
    Content cached at the edge locations -global data centers- to improves user performance.
    S3 Bucket: 
      Used for file distribution and caching at edge locations.
    Utilizes CloudFront Origin Access Control -OAC-, replacing Origin Access Identity -OAI.
    CloudFront as Ingress: 
      Ingress model:
        When you upload data using CloudFront as the entry point. 
        CloudFront:
          Takes care of the upload traffic and sends it to your S3 bucket using AWS global network.
          Determines the best path to ensure the upload happens quickly. 
            By connecting to the nearest CloudFront edge location.
      CloudFront Origin:
        The source of the content that CloudFront will deliver.
        Essentially the server or service that holds the original version of your content.
      Custom Origin Options with CloudFront:
        Application Load Balancer -ALB-.
          Cache static content served by your ALB, like images, CSS, JavaScript files, etc.
          Dynamic content isn't cached by default, but it can be.
        EC2 Instance.
          Caching and distributing content from your EC2 instance. 
        S3 Website -requires enabling as a static website-.
        HTTP Backend.
          Can cache both: 
            Static content images, videos, etc.
            Dynamic content like API responses or HTML pages served from any HTTP-S- endpoint.
  S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR):
    AWS S3 feature. 
    Automatically replicates objects from one Amazon S3 bucket to other in a different AWS region. 
    Improving: 
      Data availability.
      Resilience.
      Compliance.
      Latency for users across different geographical regions.
  The Difference Between CloudFront and S3 Cross Region Replication: 
    CloudFront:
      Global Edge network.
      Files cached for a TTL -Time To Live- for example one day.
      Ideal for static content requiring global availability.
    S3 Cross Region Replication:
      Requires setup for each region where replication is needed.
      Files update in near real-time.
      Read-only access.
      Suitable for dynamic content requiring low-latency access in specific regions.
  S3 Transfer Acceleration:
    Amazon S3 feature that speeds up the transfer of files to and from your S3 bucket. 
      By using Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations.
    How it works:
      Data Routing Through Edge Locations: 
        When you upload data to your S3 bucket using S3 Transfer Acceleration. 
        Data is first routed to the nearest CloudFront edge location.
      Optimized Path to the S3 Bucket: 
        From the edge location. 
          Data travels over AWS's optimized, high-speed global network to reach the target bucket.
    Speeds up content transfers to and from Amazon S3. 
      By as much as 50-500% for long-distance transfer of larger objects.
    Mobile & web application uploads.
    Downloads Distributed office transfers.
    Data exchange with trusted partners.
  Anycast Ips:
    Unique IP addresses assigned to your application. 
    When users connect to these IPs. 
      Their traffic is automatically routed to the closest and most optimal AWS edge location. 
        Using AWS's network.
  AWS Global Accelerator:
    Enhance your application's availability and speed worldwide with AWS's global network.
    Use AWS's network to find the best path for your application. 
      Resulting in a 60% boost in performance.
    Your application gets two special IP addresses -Anycast IPs-. 
      Directing traffic through Edge Locations. 
      2 Anycast IP are created for your application and traffic is sent through Edge Locations.
        2 IPs provide redundancy and high availability. 
          If one IP or its route encounters an issue, the other IP ensures traffic continues.
    Traffic is then routed from Edge Locations to your application, ensuring efficient delivery.
  CloudFront vs Global Accelerator:
    Both: 
      Utilize the AWS global network.
      Their edge locations worldwide and integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
    CloudFront:
      Acts as a Content Delivery Network.
      Enhancing performance for cacheable content like Images and videos.
        By serving them from edge locations.
    Global Accelerator:
      Does not cache content.
      Proxies packets at the edge to applications in one or more AWS Regions.
        Taking the traffic from the edge location and delivering it to the appropriate backend app. 
          Which may be in a different AWS region. 
        It optimizes the flow of traffic by choosing the best route.
