Other Compute Services:
  Docker
    Software development platform used to deploy applications.
  Applications are packaged in containers that can run on any operating system.
  Apps exhibit consistent behavior regardless of their deployment environment.
  Ensures no compatibility issues across different machines.
  Results in predictable behavior, reducing workload.
  Simplifies maintenance and deployment processes.
  Compatible with any programming language, operating system, and technology.
  Allows for rapid scaling of containers, with adjustments taking just seconds.
  Docker Images
    Stored in Docker Repositories, which can be public or private.
    Public Repository: 
      Docker Hub:
        Popular public repository where you can find base images for various technologies and OS: 
          Ubuntu, MySQL, NodeJS, Java, and more.
        Its like: https://hub.docker.com/
    Private Repository: 
      Amazon ECR -Elastic Container Registry- 
        Private repository service provided by AWS. 
        Allowing users to store and manage their own Docker images securely.
  Elastic Container Service -ECS-:
    A service that allows you to launch Docker containers on AWS.
    You are responsible for provisioning and maintaining the infrastructure, like EC2 instances.
    AWS takes care of starting and stopping containers for you.
  Fargate:
    Launch Docker containers on AWS without provisioning the infrastructure.
      Eliminating the need to manage EC2 instances.
    Simplifies the deployment process as it is a serverless offering.
    AWS automatically runs containers for you based on the specified CPU and RAM requirements.
      The compute resources that are allocated to the container running in the Fargate service.
  Elastic Container Registry -ECR-: 
    A private Docker registry service on AWS.
    Used to store your Docker images securely. 
      Allowing them to be easily accessed and run by ECS -Elastic Container Service- or Fargate.
  Serverless:
    Computing terminology where developers focus on deploying code or functions. 
      Without managing servers. 
    Originally, serverless was synonymous with FaaS -Function as a Service-. 
    Pioneered by AWS Lambda.
    The serverless concept now encompasses managed services for databases, messaging, storage, etc.
    The term -serverless- doesn't imply the absence of servers. 
      It means that the servers are managed by the provider, making them invisible to developers.
  Lambda:
    Eliminates the need for provisioning or managing servers.
    Triggers functions in response to events from various AWS services.
    Limited by time -short executions-.
      Lambda functions are designed for short-duration executions. 
      The maximum execution time allowed for a single Lambda invocation is 15 minutes. 
        Any Lambda function that runs for longer than this will be automatically stopped.
    Automatically scales based on demand, handling any number of requests.
    Charges only for the compute time used, with no cost when idle.
    Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services for comprehensive solutions.
    Benefits:
      Simple Pricing Structure:
        Charges based on each request and the amount of compute time used.
        Includes a generous free tier offering: 
          Up to 1,000,000 AWS Lambda requests and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time.
            Compute time: 
              In the context of AWS Lambda refers to the amount of time your function is running. 
              Calculated in milliseconds -ms-.
      Event-Driven Architecture:
        Functions are automatically triggered by AWS as required.
      Broad Programming Support:
        Compatible with numerous programming languages.
      Effortless Monitoring:
        Seamless integration with AWS CloudWatch for convenient tracking and management.
      Scalable Performance:
        Easily upgrade resources per function, with up to 10GB of RAM available.
      Enhanced RAM capacity boosts both CPU performance and network capabilities.
    Pricing:
      AWS charges for Lambda based on: 
        How long the function runs and how much memory it consumes during that time. 
        The compute time is the duration your Lambda function executes. 
          From the moment it starts until it finishes -or is stopped for exceeding time limits-.
      Pricing: 
        The charge is based on the amount of compute time used. 
          Calculated by multiplying the execution duration -seconds- by the allocated memory -GB-.
      Pay per calls:
        First 1,000,000 requests are free.
        $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter -$0.0000002 per request-.
        Pay per duration -in increment of 1 ms-:
          AWS charges for the duration in 1 ms increments. 
            If your Lambda function runs for 200 ms, you'll be billed for 200 ms, not 0.2 seconds.
          400,000 GB -seconds of compute time per month for FREE, it equals:
            400,000 seconds if function is 1GB RAM.
            3,200,000 seconds if function is 128 MB RAM.
        After that $1.00 for 600,000 GB-seconds
        It is usually very cheap to run AWS Lambda so it’s very popular
  Amazon API Gateway:
    Fully managed service for API management.
    Serverless and scalable.
    Supports RESTful and WebSocket APIs.
    Includes security, user authentication, and API throttling.
    Provides API keys and monitoring features.
  AWS Batch
    Fully managed batch processing -batch computing workloads- at any scale.
      Refers to the execution of large numbers of batch jobs, which are typically: 
        Automated, non-interactive, and long-running tasks. like: 
          Data processing, image analysis, video encoding, or scientific simulations.
    Can efficiently run hundreds of thousands of computing batch jobs on AWS.
    Batch jobs have a defined start and end, as opposed to continuous jobs.
    Dynamically launches EC2 instances or Spot Instances as needed.
    Automatically provisions the required amount of compute and memory resources.
    Allows submission or scheduling of batch jobs, with AWS Batch handling the execution.
    Batch jobs are defined as Docker images and run on ECS -Elastic Container Service-.
    Helps optimize costs and reduces focus on infrastructure management.
Lambda vs. Batch
  Batch:
    No execution time limit.
    Supports any runtime packaged as a Docker image.
      runtime refers to the software environment that executes your code. 
        It includes: 
          The programming language interpreter or compiler.
          Any libraries or dependencies required to run the code.
    Uses EBS or instance store for disk space.
    Relies on EC2 self-managed or AWS-managed.
  Lambda:
    Time-limited execution.
    Supports only specific runtimes.
    Limited temporary disk space.
    Fully serverless.
  AWS Lightsail:
    Provides virtual servers, storage, databases, and networking.
    Offers low and predictable pricing.
    Simpler alternative to using EC2, RDS, ELB, EBS, Route 53, etc.
    Ideal for individuals with limited cloud experience.
    Allows setup of notifications and monitoring for Lightsail resources.
    Use Cases:
      Simple web applications with templates for LAMP, Nginx, MEAN, Node.js, etc.
      Websites with templates for WordPress, Magento, Plesk, Joomla, etc.
      Development and testing environments.
      Offers high availability but lacks auto-scaling and has limited AWS integrations.
