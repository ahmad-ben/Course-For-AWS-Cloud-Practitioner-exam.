  AWS Right Sizing
    Selecting the most powerful isn't always the best due to the cloud's elasticity.
    Right sizing involves: 
      Matching instance types and sizes to workload requirements for optimal performance and cost.
      Reviewing deployed instances. 
        To find opportunities for downsizing without compromising capacity, reducing costs.
    Scaling up is easy, so it's advisable to start with smaller instances.
    It's crucial to right size: 
      Before migration. 
      After onboarding continuously, as requirements change.
    Tools can assist in right sizing:
      CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor, and third-party tools..
Amazon EC2 Pricing Options:
  Summary of the Amazon EC2 pricing Options:
    On-Demand: 
      Flexible and straightforward with no commitments. 
      Ideal for short-term or unpredictable workloads.
    Reserved Instances -RI-: 
      Discounted -up to 75%- for committing to one or three years. 
      Suitable for steady-state applications -predictable-. 
      We can also reserve capacity with Reserved Instances as well.
      Offers options like: 
        Standard -limited modifications-.
          AZ, Instance size in Linux, Networking type. 
        Convertible -more flexibility to change attributes-. 
          AZ, Instance size in Linux, Networking type, family, OS, payment option. 
      Payment options include all upfront, partial upfront, or no upfront.
        upfront having the best discount, but no suitable for cash flow and vice versa. 
      Instance attributes should match the attributes of reserved instance to see discounts, like:
        Type of instance you're running, operating system, The tenancy, AZ and the region.
      When you specify an AZ, you can also reserve capacity in it, but not by region.
      If you no longer need them, you can sell RIs on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.
    Spot Instances: 
      Offers up to 90% discounts by bidding for unused capacity but can be interrupted by AWS. 
      Ideal for flexible workloads that can handle interruptions.
      We have three types:
        Spot instance: One or more spot instances.
        Spot fleet: 
          AWS launches and maintains a specified number of spot instances. 
            You can be mix in on-demand instances to meet a certain capacity. 
        EC2 fleet: 
          AWS launches and maintains a specified number of spot, on-demand, and reserved instances. 
            All in a single API call. 
          You can define a lot of setting here, it's very flexible.
    Dedicated Instances:
